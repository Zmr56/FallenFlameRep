[MidRight]#Wren
This spot should be good to spar in,[N]
ready Wigbrand?[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
Poised as ever Lady Wren. Steel your[N]
blade and strike just as a Blumari[A][N]
Kingdom knight should![A]

[MidLeft][LoadWigbrand]

[MidRight]#Wren
Phew... you took the air out of me[N]
there... Well... good enough for the[A][N]
frontlines now?[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
A distinct improvement from our last[N]
session. But our duels are a far cry[A][N]
from fighting bloodthirsty enemies on a[N]
real battlefield, understood?[A]

[MidRight]#Wren
Mhmm, but I've bore witeness to such a[N]
scene due to the state of Woadlan.[A][N]
Many times have I seen my father deal[N]
with bandits and such there and then.[A][N]
I understand what's at stake.[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
I suppose so, your father and I have[N]
never hid the truth of war from you.[A][N]
Maybe you're ready after all.[N]
I'm confident in your knowledge of[A][N]
tactical theory but the only way to[N]
test your leadership abilities is to[A][N]
eventually put you through the wringer[N]
of an actual battle one day.[A]

[MidRight]#Wren
That could be soon even. I've heard[N]
milita men in here started banditry.[A][N]
Supposedly, they wanted higher pay but[N]
parliament has invested into the war[A][N]
effort in the east instead. Equipping[N]
knights fighting Manaketes is costly.[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
It's an unusual decision but I suppose[N]
knights are effective at lobbying.[A][N]
Knowing your father, he'd blow most of[N]
his pay onto garments and hair dye.[A]

[MidRight]#Wren
That is most untrue Wigbrand![A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
That's what you'd like to believe.[N]
He's probably leaving most of the real[A][N]
work to someone else anyway. Meanwhile[N]
we're out here scouting the highlands[A][N]
for...[A]
[X]

[Left][LoadShamira]
[FarLeft][LoadOrvar]

[Left]#Shamira
Bandits up ahead lady Wren! Apologies[N]
for the delayed notice. I was compelled[A][N]
to haul Orvar over here as to prevent[N]
him from being hacked to death.[A]

[FarRight]#Wigbrand
Perfect timing...?[A]

[FarLeft]#Orvar
There was no need to drag me here by my[N]
ear like that sis, tch... I would've[A][N]
made it out of the woods myself.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Why were you in the woods in the first[N]
place? And why are you clutching a bag[A][N]
of mushrooms...?[A]

[FarLeft]#Orvar
Well... Uhh... You see while scouting I[N]
uhh...[A]

[Left][Clear]
[Left][LoadHuginn]

[Left]#Huginn
Save it for later Orvar,[N]
we've got bandits to bash.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace]

[FarRight][LoadWigbrand]

[FarRight]#Wigbrand
Aptly put as ever Huginn, seems like[N]
you'll be getting that valuable[A][N]
learning experience much earlier than[N]
anticipated, Lady Wren.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Aye, let's get to it then![A]
[X]

## PrologueReinforcementText

[MidLeft][LoadDatta]
Looks like there's a bunch of sword[N]
users amongst that crowd of knights...[A][N]
No worry, back-up should be coming soon[N]
our sellsword will cut them deep![A][N]
[X]

## PrologueClosingText

[Right][LoadWren]
[Left][LoadWigbrand]

[Right]#Wren
The commander has fallen and whatever's[N]
left has scattered. Do we pursue?[A]

[Left]#Wigbrand
They've all gone their own ways, a[N]
lonesome crook is of no concern for us.[A][N]
Although I couldn't help but notice the[N]
Shamans and Fighters in their ranks.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Seems like Gofaullic pirates are aiding[N]
them. One day the milita are fighting[A][N]
pirates, then mixing together the next![N]
Such a disloyal bunch...[A]

[Left]#Wigbrand
Countries and sovereign states are of[N]
little importance to these peasants.[A][N]
If the state cannot feed its people,[N]
expect mansions and castles to burn.[A]

[Right]#Wren
I suppose their plight is dire...[A]

[Left]#Wigbrand
Expect other parts of Woadlan to be[N]
burning thanks to their efforts, Wren.[A][N]
We must hurry back to the castle, I've[N]
no doubt pirates will be there soon.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Aye, I'm prepared to clash with more[N]
of the rogues. We'll march on, lest[A][N]
the rest of Blumari be enflammed.[N]
Let's get to it then![A]
[X]

## PrologueHuginnWrenTalk

[Right][LoadWren]
[Left][LoadHuginn]

[Right]#Wren
Huginn, mind if I ask how your family[N]
fares in Gofaul? I heard fighting has[A][N]
been intense in the country on the[N]
colony frontier where they live.[A]

[Left]#Huginn
They don't live there no more. Muninn[N]
set up a blacksmith's in the capital[A][N]
with the gold from my mercenary work.[N]
Family moved with him so they're fine.[A][N]
Harvest wasn't any good so they had to[N]
give up on the farm.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Mhmm, I've heard this summer has been[N]
unusually wet, with plenty of flooding.[A]

[Left]#Huginn
It's the war. The titan spirits can't[N]
nurture the land if men are spilling[A][N]
blood between each other instead of[N]
the usual animal sacrifices.[A]

[Right]#Wren
I think it's just the changing weather.[N]
That's all. But then again, I'm not a[A][N]
pagan like other Gofauls.[A]

[Left]#Huginn
Other Gofauls? Aren't you from[N]
Blumari?[A]

[Right]#Wren
I am, but my mother is a Gofaul.[N]
So I'm half Gofaullic.[A]

[Left]#Huginn
This is news to me. Sir Kestral married[N]
a Gofaul?[A]

[Right]#Wren
For anyone who knew him when he was[N]
younger it's no surprise I guess. But[A][N]
father is very different now.[A]

[Left]#Huginn
Hmm. Well, alright then.[A]
[X]
