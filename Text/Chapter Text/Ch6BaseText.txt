[Right]#Wren
I don't think I need to even ask as to[N]
why you're up here on a cold and stormy[A][N]
night, Rudyard.[A]

[Left]#Rudyard
Let me guess, Nuri's already ranted[N]
about me to you?[A]

[Right]#Wren
Don't worry, I'm not gonna drag her up[N]
here. Still, you should head down soon.[A]

[Left]#Rudyard
I can wait it out until she's asleep.[N]
What about you? You ought be in a warm[A][N]
and cosy bed right now. With weather[N]
like this you'll catch a cold.[A]

[Right]#Wren
It's easier to sleep knowing my troops[N]
aren't out catching a cold themselves.[A][N]
Besides, Nuri is probably too tired to[N]
chase you up right now anyway.[A]

[Left]#Rudyard
Alright... If it makes things easier[N]
for you then. Night, Wren.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Ahem.[N][A]

[Left]#Rudyard
What?[N]
Oh![A][N]
Night, Lady Wren. Sorry, usually I'm[N]
the one being cal-[A][N]
Ah, nevermind. Night.[A]

[Right]#Wren

[Right]#Wren
Hey Shamira.[N][A]

[Left]#Shamira
Hey.[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
...[N]
You ok?[A]

[Left]#Shamira
I am. Why do you ask?[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
Well you're staring into the distance[N]
despondently and I also didn't see you[A][N]
when we were at Seyfaut Keep.[A]

[Left]#Shamira
I'm just thinking back on the place.[N]
Now that we're gone. Did you realise[A][N]
why I didn't show up back then?[A]

[Right]#Wren
Sorta. I don't blame you.[N]
I know you're gonna say sorry for not[A][N]
being there with me after the meeting[N]
but don't worry about it.[A]

[Left]#Shamira
...[N]
Can I say it anyway?[A]

[Right]#Wren
Sure. On one condition though.[N][A]

[Left]#Shamira
Oh? What might that be?[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
Promise me you won't subject yourself[N]
to this weather any longer and that[A][N]
you'll head to bed to enjoy a good[N]
night's rest?[A]

[Left]#Shamira
I'll try and pass this mission with[N]
flying colours then, commander.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Heh, that's the Shamira we love.[N]
Goodnight.[A]

[Left]#Shamira
Night.[N][A]

Tornado! Hurricane! Whirlwind![N][A]

[Right][LoadWren]

[Right]#Wren
Umm, Iara? What are you doing?[N][A]

[Left]#Iara
Practising my wind magic.[N]
What better time to work on it than a[A][N]
stormy night like this?[A]

[Right]#Wren
But I'm sure those aren't actual spells[N]
that anyone could use...[A]

[Left]#Iara
Oh I know! But do you really think it[N]
can sound cool shouting "Wind!"?[A][N]
I've tried and trust me, it can't.[A]

[Right]#Wren
So then... How does this help you with[N]
practising your wind magic, exactly?[A]

[Left]#Iara
Gets me pumped up. I've gotta be pumped[N]
up for when we go into Gofaul.[A][N]
Don't you agree?[A]

[Right]#Wren
I mean, I guess?[N]
Just don't catch a cold while you're at[A][N]
it, yeah?[A]

[Left]#Iara
You underestimate my power, Lady Wren.[N]
I am in control of this storm! No harm[A][N]
can befall me! Mwahahaha![A]

[Right]#Wren
(She isn't shivering at all...)[N]
I'll uh, take your word for it then.[A][N]
Night, Iara.[A]

[Left]#Iara
Goodnight, Lady Wren![N]
Nice talking to you![A]
