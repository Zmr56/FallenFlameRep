[Right]#Sarai
Hey, Wren. Why can't we be travelling[N]
with the rest of the Blumari army?[A][N]
I just want to be sailing on a boat.[N]
All this riding is leaving me tired...[A]

[Left]#Wren
Sir Kestral still wants the escort[N]
mission to the capital to be on the[A][N]
down low. So a small force like ours is[N]
preferred to accompny Adela.[A]

[FarLeft]#Wigbrand
Sir Kestral does not want to risk a[N]
repeat of the last incident on seas.[A][N]
If we travel in a small group like ours[N]
we can reduce the risk of attracting[A][N]
enemy attention.[A]

[Left]#Wren
Speaking of enemies, has your scout[N]
returned yet, Adela?[A]

[FarRight]#Adela
Not yet, although I think I can see[N]
Nuri over the horizon there.[A]

[Right][ClearFace]
[Right][LoadNuri]

[Right]#Nuri
Ready to report, princess Adela![N][A]

[FarRight]#Adela
How does the situation look up ahead,[N]
Nuri? You seem a bit tense.[A]

[Right]#Nuri
A band of enemies was spotted up ahead.[N]
I believe this is the last remnant of[A][N]
enemies that was left behind after the[N]
failed citadel attack. I suppose they[A][N]
wanted to leave some troops behind to[N]
attack us when we were more vulnerable.[A]

[Left]#Wren
It's nothing to worry about, Adela. I'm[N]
pretty confident by this point that we[A][N]
can push through this final batch of[N]
enemies unscathed. Once we're done with[A][N]
this lot, the invasion ought be over[N]
practically speaking.[A]

[FarRight]#Adela
I believe in you Wren. What's the[N]
objective then?[A]

[Left]#Wren
If we take out their commanders I think[N]
that will be enough for them to realise[A][N]
the invasion is lost. They'll disperse[N]
and we can press on ahead.[A]

[Right]#Nuri
You may want to be careful of the caves[N]
up ahead, Lady Wren. I could see[A][N]
Wyvern Riders lurking within. They may[N]
appear as reinforcements.[A]

[Left]#Wren
I'll keep that in mind, Nuri. Let's[N]
head out then.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Now that both commanders are defeated,[N]
it'd seem the enemy remnants have fled.[A]

[FarRight]#Wigbrand
It's safe to say the enemy is no longer[N]
on Blumari shores so we can advance to[A][N]
Seyfaut safely.[A]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
Hoorah! Our home is free once more![N]
Woo! I'm all tuckered out though.[A]

[Left]#Adela
I'm looking forward to heading there so[N]
I can reunite with my cousin.[A]

[Right]#Wren
I've been meaning to ask the king about[N]
a number of things...[A]

[FarRight]#Wigbrand
Best think about those things later.[N]
We must make haste for the capital.[A][N]
There's important manners of business[N]
that will need to be arranged.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Right, we'll advance promptly then.[N][A]
[X]

[Left]#Nuri
Erasyl...? Is that you?[A]

[Right]#Rudyard
Hmm, that name sounds familiar. Your[N]
boyfriend? Sounds like the name of a[A][N]
good looking guy, for sure! But I've[N]
gotta dash, see ya![A]

[Left]#Nuri
Hey! Wait up! Grr... I'm sure that's[N]
him! Irresponsible lout...[A]

## Ch4RudyardAdelaTalk

[Right][LoadRudyard]
[Left][LoadAdela]

[Left]#Adela
You... You look familiar.[A]

[Right]#Rudyard
Princess Adela! I don't believe we've[N]
ever met. I am a simple retainer of[A][N]
Duke Wystan after all, from a common[N]
background.[A]

[Left]#Adela
Is that so?[A]

[Right]#Rudyard
You can ask the Duke himself, he'll be[N]
more than happy to tell you of my[A][N]
background. There's no secrecy, I can[N]
assure you.[A]

[Left]#Adela
Fair enough. I just thought you looked[N]
like Erasyl Hasib, the heir to the[A][N]
Marqlans Sultanate. He was someone I[N]
knew of from Eastern Viripuria.[A]

[Right]#Rudyard
You flatter me. But I can assure you[N]
I'm no prince, sadly. I get that a lot,[A][N]
but you're mistaken. Farewell.[A]

[ClearFace][Right]

[Left]#Adela
Maybe I am... It's been a while since I[N]
saw Erasyl last anyway.[A]
