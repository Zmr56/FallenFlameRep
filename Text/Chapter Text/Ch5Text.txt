[Left]#Shamira
*Sigh*...[A]

[Right][LoadOrvar]

[Right]#Orvar
Still on the ship, sis?[A]

[Left]#Shamira
Don't worry, I'm coming down.[A]

[Right]#Orvar
This usually isn't like you.[N]
Did I do something to upset you again?[A]

[Left]#Shamira
It's not that... It's just you know,[N]
when we were back in the Blooport.[A]

[Right]#Orvar
Did it bring back memories?[A]

[Left]#Shamira
Yeah... I guess.[N]
It just makes me realise how much[A][N]
different things are over there.[N]
They have it pretty well, don't they?[A]

[Right]#Orvar
..and Woadlan and Wystan get nothing.[N]
I don't see why they fortified the[A][N]
capital so heavily and left us to[N]
stretch ourselves so thin.[A]

[Left]#Shamira
That's just how it's always been.[N]
They'll work us like donkeys because[A][N]
they can. They see us as donkeys too.[A]

[Right]#Orvar
Lemme guess, your old friends at the[N]
Blooport Guard didn't give a damn when[A][N]
you showed up again last week?[A]

[Left]#Shamira
Something like that. I'm just glad to[N]
be with you and Wren, brother.[A]

[Right]#Orvar
Me too, sis. As long as we got each[N]
other, we don't need to cosy up to the[A][N]
Blooport bigwigs.[A]

[Right][LoadLuz]

[Right]#Luz
...and give us your blessing,[N]
oh great Goddess. Verily.[A]

[Left][LoadRudyard]

[Left]#Rudyard
Hey, Luz. You ready to head out?[A]

[Right]#Luz
Oh, Rudyard. Are you here to pray too?[A]

[Left]#Rudyard
Nah, just checking on you.[N]
Sarai sent me over here.[A]

[Right]#Luz
Ah, very well. I won't be too long.[N]
You should pray too, you know.[A][N]
It's a rare occassion to be able to[N]
make the pilgrimage to Blessia.[A]

[Left]#Rudyard
Yeah, yeah... I know. I'm just not[N]
ready yet, you know?[A]

[Right]#Luz
How so? Even a short prayer will do.[N]
Praying here for a moment will reward[A][N]
you with a year's worth of blessings.[N]
We surely need all the Goddess' love[A][N]
for the road ahead.[A]

[Left]#Rudyard
The Goddess is probably merciful enough[N]
to let me off this one time.[A][N]
She might protect me anyway. I think.[N]
Is that how it works...?[A]

[Right]#Luz
If you struggle to find the heart to[N]
pray for yourself... I won't force you.[A][N]
But please, at the very least pray for[N]
lady Sarai. I know your faith is shaky[A][N]
right now Rudyard, but you do believe.[A]

[Left]#Rudyard
...I guess. Sure, I'll do it then.[N]
Maybe next year I'll be back and put in[A][N]
a prayer for myself.[A]

[Right]#Luz
Thank you, Rudyard.[N]
It really means a lot to me.[A]

[Left]#Rudyard
No problem! Now...[N]
Oh Goddess, uhh... I umm...[A][N]
Luz, I might've forgotten the words...[A]

[Right]#Luz
Don't worry, I'll guide you through it.[N]
Now, Oh Goddess...[A]

[Right][LoadCato]

[Right]#Cato
Such savages...[A]

[Left][LoadWren]

[Left]#Wren
What's that there, elder Cato?[A]

[Right]#Cato
It appears to be a painting of someone.[N]
Albeit, enemies have tarnished it.[A][N]
The remains of it feel familiar to me.[A]

[Left]#Wren
That would be a painting of my mother,[N]
Priestess Godiva Osprey.[A]

[Right]#Cato
Hmmm, the name rings no bells.[N]
Still, it bears some similarities to a[A][N]
chieftain's daughter near my home.[A]

[Left]#Wren
Would that be Heidrun Siguld?[A]

[Right]#Cato
Funnily enough yes... How did you know?[A]

[Left]#Wren
Because they're one and the same![N]
My mum had to change her name.[A][N]
She had to convert from paganism when[N]
marrying my dad. Naturally the name[A][N]
changed from a pagan one too.[N]

[Right]#Cato
That's... Peculiar. Your mother was...[N]
Well, she didn't seem like she'd settle[A][N]
down here. Based on what I knew of her.[A]

[Left]#Wren
How so, Cato?[A]

[Right]#Cato
She was a wildchild back in the day.[N]
Terrifying warrior too. She valued[A][N]
her independence greatly and turned[N]
down many a suitor seeking her love.[A]

[Left]#Wren
Huh, that's usually what people say[N]
about my dad. Weird. Oh well, I guess[A][N]
they must've had a lot in common.[N]
People don't usually talk about my mum.[A]

[Right]#Cato
Perhaps that'd explain why you were[N]
happy to stop around for a chat in the[A][N]
middle of a battle when we met.[N]
Only your mother would've done[A][N]
something like that. She always took[N]
out time to know others.[A][N]
Yes, she was a very sociable figure.[A]

[Left]#Wren
I guess a part of me is like that too.[N]
Although, wildchild? Ehh...[A][N]
I don't see that in myself...[A]

[Right]#Cato
I suppose. You're your own person,[N]
after all. Although if you don't return[A][N]
to the field, maybe Wigbrand might find[N]
wildchild to be an apt description.[A]

[Left]#Wren
Oh dear! We've really ran over time.[N]
Well, take care elder Cato![A]
