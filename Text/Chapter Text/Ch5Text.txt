[Left]#Evander
Ah, lady Wren! We're coming close to[N]
Animahead now. Is the coast clear?[A]

[Right]#Wren
I've sent Sarai to scout up ahead,[N]
we've been lucky so far not to run[A][N]
into pirates so far so I'm optimistic.[N]
Speaking of Sarai, here she is![A]

[FarLeft][LoadSarai]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
*pant* *pant* d-d-DRAGONS![N]
I saw dragons! Big ones![A]

[Left]#Evander
Damnit! Wyvember must be supporting[N]
the invading pirates with their own[A][N]
forces. No doubt trying to plunder[N]
all manner of loot for their coffers.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Alert the princess, Evander! I'll[N]
make preperations to dock.[A]

[Left][ClearFace]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
It wasn't just wyverns by the way...[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
You don't mean...[N][A]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
I saw Manaketes transformed. It's been[N]
over a hundred years since they last[A][N]
attacked Animahead like this.[N]
I know they're weakened by the clergy's[A][N]
blessings placed on the island but[N]
still, be careful, Wren! This could be[A][N]
our toughest fight...[A]

[Right]#Wren
I've got the Falchion by my side. We've[N]
plenty of reason to believe we'll win.[A][N]
Trust me.[A]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
I hope so...[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
Alright, everyone ready?[N][A]

[Left][LoadIara]
[FarLeft][LoadApollo]

[Left]#Iara
Ready as ever, lady no name![N][A]

[Right]#Wren
Gwah! Where did you come from?[N]
Whoever you are...[A]

[FarLeft]#Apollo
Pardon me, milady. What my colleague[N]
lacks in discipline, she makes up for[A][N]
in fighting spirit. My name is Apollo.[A]

[Left]#Iara
And my name is Iara! Nice to meetcha![N]
Now let's slay these salamanders![A]

[ClearFace][Left]

[Right]#Wren
...[N][A]

[FarLeft]#Apollo
You know what, I'll just save the intro[N]
for when this dragon business is over.[A][N]
For now we need to rout these heretics[N]
fast before they desecrate this holy[A][N]
land further, pillaging our relics.[A]

[Right]#Wren
That'd be more than fine...[N][A]
[X]

[Left][LoadWigbrand]

[Right]#Wren
Looks like they're all routed then.[N][A]

[Left]#Wigbrand
Wyvember shouldn't have been able to[N]
reach as far as Animahead's shores.[A][N]
Something is certainly amiss here.[A]

[Right]#Wren
We should press on to the colony.[N]
I'll be able to get some answers[A][N]
from my uncle about what's gone[N]
wrong. He's the governor after all.[A]

[Left]#Wigbrand
Knowing him, he's probably why[N]
we've got this mess on our hands.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Sorry... I honestly think he tries his[N]
best but Ospretia is a difficult colony[A][N]
to govern and he's made some enemies.[A]

[Left]#Wigbrand
I'll agree on those last two points.[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
Your mind probably won't change on that[N]
first point so I won't argue about this[A][N]
now. Let's get going to the Archbishop.[A]

[Right][LoadWren]

[Right]#Wren
Hello? Are you there, Archbishop?[N][A]

[Left][LoadArchbishop]

[Left]#Archbishop
Hello, Lady Wren. Were the[N]
blessings we placed on the[A][N]
island sufficient for you?[A]

[Right]#Wren
Yes, the manaketes were weakened enough[N]
for us to take them down before they[A][N]
plundered enough from the church.[A]

[Left]#Archbishop
Ah yes... That was our worry and one[N]
that relates to your sword, Falchion.[A][N]
You wanted to learn more about it, yes?[A]

[Right]#Wren
Indeed, I was advised to come here for[N]
that reason in fact. Could you explain?[A]

[Left]#Archbishop
Falchion is a dragon slaying sword.[N]
Forged from the fang of a legendary[A][N]
dragon, Soma Ashoka. The last emperor[N]
of Wyvember before Emperor Vritra.[A]

[Right]#Wren
...![N][A]

[Left]#Archbishop
I understand this is quite a shock.[N]
Especially given only you can wield[A][N]
this blade. Well, so can your mother.[N]
However, she did not want to partake[A][N]
in the war, instead she went on a[N]
pilgrimage to Viripuria's far east.[A]

[Right]#Wren
She spoke with me and my father about[N]
her decision a few times when we last[A][N]
saw her. Sometimes she writes letters.[N]
I understand and respect her decision.[A]

[Left]#Archbishop
Naturally, it means you must be the[N]
one to wield Falchion. No one else[A][N]
can unlock the draconic power of it.[A]

[Right]#Wren
This is what I'm confused about though.[N]
*Why* is it only me who can wield it?[A][N]
I've never even drank dragon's blood.[A]

[Left]#Archbishop
We've studied extensively for an answer[N]
but all we can say is it's a miracle.[A][N]
Given time, maybe you'll learn more.[A]

[Right]#Wren
...[N]
That's it?[A]

[Left]#Archbishop
Excuse me?[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
I risked my life for you and everyone[N]
else here against literal manaketes[A][N]
only for you to tell me that actually[N]
you don't really know!? That it's just[A][N]
a funny little miracle? Seriously?[A]

[Left]#Archbishop
Young lady![N][A]

[Right]#Wren
Nope. Forget this. I know you know.[N][A]

[Left]#Archbishop
You would accuse me of lying?[N]
Me, the head of Blumari's church!?[A]

[Right]#Wren
My mother has given her life to this[N]
church, she gave up her old one for it![A][N]
Yet you can't even give me the dignity[N]
of the truth. I pray and I pray every[A][N]
single day! I follow all the rules and[N]
still it's not enough for your respect![A]

[Left]#Archbishop
You should show a little yourself![N][A]

[Right]#Wren
Whatever, clearly I'm not wanted here.[N][A]

[Right][ClearFace]

[Left]#Archbishop
*sigh* Oh Lady Wren...[N]
I wish I could tell you more.[A][N]
If not me then certainly you,[N]
the one who skulks in the shadows.[A]

[Right][LoadWigbrand]

[Right]#Wigbrand
She'll learn when she's ready.[N][A]

[Left]#Archbishop
Does it not choke you up from within?[N]
Denying her of the truth she is owed?[A]

[Right]#Wigbrand
It does not matter to me.[N][A]

[Left]#Archbishop
Or is it that you can't let it matter?[N][A]

[Right]#Wigbrand
...[N]
Hmph.[A]

[Right][ClearFace]

[Left]#Archbishop
I'm sorry, Wren...[N][A]
