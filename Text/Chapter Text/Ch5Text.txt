[Left]#Evander
Ah, lady Wren! We're coming close to[N]
Animahead now. Is the coast clear?[A]

[Right]#Wren
I've sent Sarai to scout up ahead,[N]
we've been lucky so far not to run[A][N]
into pirates so far so I'm optimistic.[N]
Speaking of Sarai, here she is![A]

[FarLeft][LoadSarai]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
*pant* *pant* d-d-DRAGONS![N]
I saw dragons! Big ones![A]

[Left]#Evander
Damnit! Wyvember must be supporting[N]
the invading pirates with their own[A][N]
forces. No doubt trying to plunder[N]
all manner of loot for their coffers.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Alert the princess, Evander! I'll[N]
make preperations to dock.[A]

[Left][ClearFace]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
It wasn't just wyverns by the way...[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
You don't mean...[N][A]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
I saw Manaketes transformed. It's been[N]
over a hundred years since they last[A][N]
attacked Animahead like this.[N]
I know they're weakened by the clergy's[A][N]
blessings placed on the island but[N]
still, be careful, Wren! This could be[A][N]
our toughest fight...[A]

[Right]#Wren
I've got the Falchion by my side. We've[N]
plenty of reason to believe we'll win.[A][N]
Trust me.[A]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
I hope so...[N][A]

Alright, everyone ready?[N][A]

[FarLeft][LoadApollo]

[Left]#Iara
Ready as ever, lady no name![N][A]

[Right]#Wren
Gwah! Where did you come from?[N]
Whoever you are...[A]

[FarLeft]#Apollo
Pardon me, milady. What my colleague[N]
lacks in discipline, she makes up for[A][N]
in fighting spirit. My name is Apollo.[A]

[Left]#Iara
And my name is Iara! Nice to meetcha![N]
Now let's slay these salamanders![A]

[ClearFace][Left]

[Right]#Wren
...[N][A]

[FarLeft]#Apollo
You know what, I'll just save the intro[N]
for when this dragon business is over.[A][N]
For now we need to rout these heretics[N]
fast before they desecrate this holy[A][N]
land further, pillaging our relics.[A]

[Right]#Wren
That'd be more than fine...[N][A]
