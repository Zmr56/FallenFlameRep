[Right]#Wren
There she is... Ospretia.[N]
Sarai! How's it looking?[A]

[Left][LoadSarai]

[Left]#Sarai
Not good! There's pirates about![N]
Well, not just pirates. There's[A][N]
other soldiers from Wyvember too[N]
and some in Ospretian uniform![A]

[Right]#Wren
Ospretians fighting against Blumari?[N]
That's impossible! Unless... *sigh*[A]

[Left]#Sarai
Huh? What is it?[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
My uncle has a habit of upsetting[N]
certain people in Ospretia. Wyvember[A][N]
probably saw an opportunity to fan the[N]
flames of rebellion with their anger.[A]

[Left]#Sarai
He's probably being held hostage then.[N]
We ought get to him quickly, Wren.[A]

[Right]#Wren
I know. These turncoats will pay for[N]
taking my family from me. Let's dock[A][N]
and move out to attack, everyone![A]
