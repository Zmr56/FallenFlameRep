Hyah! Hah! Hyaaah![N]
...[A][N]
Well, I'm spent...[N]
You know now that I'm resting this[A][N]
would be a good time to speak up.[A]

[Right][LoadWren]

[Right]#Wren
Oh! My apologies... I didn't realise[N]
you noticed me watching. I'm awfully[A][N]
sorry to have intruded on your session.[A]

[Left]#Nemain
Don't be. You wanna learn how to master[N]
the sword, right?[A]

[Right]#Wren
Indeed... If I'm to wield Falchion then[N]
I must follow in my mother's footsteps[A][N]
and aspire to be a master in the blade.[A]

[Left]#Nemain
And another master in the blade you've[N]
found to follow in me. Let's spar then![A]

[Right]#Wren
Thank you, teacher![N]
I'll give you everything I've got![A]

[Right]#Wren
Ha... Ha... Ahh...[N][A]

[Left]#Nemain
Yep, you definitely went all out.[N]
I must say, I'm impressed.[A][N]
I can definitely work with this.[N]
Did you enjoy our session then?[A]

[Right]#Wren
L-let me catch my breath...[N][A]

[Left]#Nemain
I mean even a nod will do.[N][A]

[Left]#Nemain
Heh, being a teacher is kind of fun.[N]
Better than hanging out with the goons[A][N]
I was with before. I've been missing[N]
having some time with the girls since.[A]

[Right]#Wren
I definitely feel stronger...[N]
Thank you, teacher.[A]

[Left]#Nemain
Just Nemain will do. You saved my life[N]
back in the city so I owe you big time.[A][N]
Consider this as paying my debt to you.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Sure, Nemain. I appreciate it.[N][A]

[Left]#Nemain
Although...[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
Hm?[N][A]

[Left]#Nemain
You see, I'm a bit of a greedy gal.[N]
Mind me requesting one other thing?[A]

[Right]#Wren
Well it'd depend on what it is...[N][A]

[Left]#Nemain
Promise me you can get me a sparring[N]
session with ol' Wigbrand, yeah?[A][N]
I've wanted to fight against that famed[N]
sword arm for years now...[A]

[Right]#Wren
Hmm...[N]
I'll see what I can do.[A]

[Left]#Nemain
I look forward to it, Lady Wren.[N][A]
