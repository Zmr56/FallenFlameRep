[MidLeft]#Wren
We're here Wigbrand, I've sent Sarai to[N]
scout the port just in case however.[A][N]
Uhh... Wigbrand? Where are you...?[A]

[MidRight][LoadWigbrand]

[MidRight]#Wigbrand
I'm... here... Wren... bleugh...[N][A]

[MidLeft]#Wren
Oh my! You look awfully pale! I didn't[N]
know that seasickness could get to you.[AN]

[MidRight]#Wigbrand
The sea is...[N]
not something I am[A][N]
accustomed to...[N]
Where's Sarai...?[A][N]
Is it safe up ahead?[AN][CloseSpeechSlow]

[MidRight][LoadSarai]

[MidRight]#Sarai
Here! And I'm afraid not... Pirates[N]
have swarmed the port up ahead, but[A][N]
we've got some support. My father[N]
anticipated our arrival so he's sent[A][N]
two of my retainers over, Luz and Gad![A][N][CloseSpeechSlow]

[MidRight]#Luz
Hello Lady Wren, If you need a heal in[N]
a pinch I'm more than happy to help and[A][N]
wish the Goddess' blessings upon you.[A]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
Oho, you're so polite, Luz. I'm quite[N]
envious of your grace. Now, introduce[A][N]
yourself, Gad![A]

[Right]#Gad
Hey Wren, I'm Gad. I open locks, steal[N]
treasure and look good doing it. If you[A][N]
need to know the best gambling dens on[N]
the Blumari coast I'm your guy![A]

[MidLeft]#Wren
I'd uhh... rather not. I value my[N]
relationship with the Goddess. Sorry.[A]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
Gad! Not like that![N][A]

[MidRight]#Luz
I tell myself to expect nothing decent[N]
from his behaviour yet he has the power[A][N]
to still disappoint. It's astonishing,[N]
really, Lady Wren.[A]

[Right]#Gad
Whatever, you nobles aren't any fun...[N][A]

[MidLeft]#Wren
Anyway... back with the task at hand,[N]
I believe taking out their commander[A][N]
should disperse the pirates from here.[N]
Once they've gone, we can press on.[A][N]
Sound good?[A]

[MidRight]#Sarai
Agreed, Wren. Let's head to it![N][A]

[FarRight]#Wigbrand
As long as we're not sailing off again,[N]
I really don't care what we do...[A]

[MidRight]#Wren
Port looks safe now, no pirates in[N]
sight. I think we can press onto the[A][N]
Aquanpool Citadel safely now?[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
Should do, unless the enemy learnt of[N]
our next steps during their ambush on[A][N]
Sir Kestral at sea. An attack en route[N]
to the citadel or at the citadel itself[A][N]
are entirely possible in that instance.[A]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
Wiggy, you should try being an optimist[N]
more often. It's nothing to worry about[A][N]
Wren! Worst case scenario? My father,[N]
the renowed Shield of Blumari, Duke[A][N]
Wystan will simply eliminate them once[N]
they get there. He's strong you know![A][N]
Plus, it's his citadel, he knows it[N]
better than the enemy does.[A]

[MidRight]#Wren
Well, I suppose at a glance that sort[N]
of attack on a Blumari citadel seems[A][N]
unlikely to work, even if auxillary[N]
pirate cannon fodder is spreading our[A][N]
resources thin across the island.[N]
I'm struggling to see their rationale[A][N]
behind this reckless attack however.[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
As you know Western Viripuria is split[N]
in two by a bloody civil war. On one[A][N]
hand you have the Imperialists, on the[N]
other, the Wyvember backed forces,[A][N]
the Golden Revolutionaries. Right now[N]
Princess Adela and Emperor Ivan are the[A][N]
only members of the imperial dynasty[N]
that we know to be alive. Prince[A][N]
Vladmir's whereabouts are unknown.[A]

[MidRight]#Wren
I'm aware... It's been 6 months since[N]
he last replied to my letters...[A]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
It's alright Wren... I'm sure he's out[N]
there somewhere...[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
Ahem. Anyhow, if Wyvember were to kill[N]
Adela now, this would be a huge blow to[A][N]
the morale of the Imperialists while[N]
they're already in dire straits. Then[A][N]
they can focus their efforts on purging[N]
that dynasty and destroying the very[A][N]
thing the Imperialists fight for. Then[N]
it will only be a matter of time for[A][N]
the victory of the rebels to be sealed.[A]

[MidRight]#Wren
Even so, why do they need to already[N]
undertake a risky operation during this[A][N]
stage in the war?[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
Time is against the Manaketes. If they[N]
don't act fast, they'll continue to[A][N]
succumb to their degenerating mental[N]
state unless they expand into foreign[A][N]
lands where magic is more plentiful to[N]
sustain their dragon forms. The sooner[A][N]
they act, the better. Once they've[N]
strengthened their coalition of[A][N]
pirates, revolutionaries and dragons,[N]
they can take the Eastern Viripurian[A][N]
Empire where magic is in abundance.[A]

[MidRight]#Wren
Then I guess they're unlikely to hold[N]
back on this chance. We ought be[A][N]
prepared for such an outcome... Let's[N]
press on then.[A]

[MidLeft]
Ack! What was that noise?[N][A]

[MidRight]
Wyverns. The roar sounds like it came[N]
from the north-east. It appears the[A][N]
pirates are working with Wyvember.[N]
They don't sound too far away, prepare[A][N]
for an attack by them soon, Wren.[A]

[Right]#Luz
Oh my! Wigbrand, you look awfully pale.[N]
I can't heal up your sea sickness but[A][N]
I have some blessed herbs to relive you[N]
of your ailment.[A]

[Left]#Wigbrand
Pah, leave me alone. Your so called[N]
blessed herbs are mere vegetables.[A]

[Right]#Luz
How rude, I never knew you to have[N]
such a sharp tongue, Wigbrand.[A]

[Left]#Wigbrand
Hmph, I certainly do not need any[N]
blessings to see myself through. Gods[A][N]
and Goddesses have done nothing but[N]
bring me and this world misery.[A]

[Right]#Luz
I take it you're not a man of any faith[N]
then?[A]

[Left]#Wigbrand
Was. Then they stabbed me in the back[N]
and took everything I knew away from[A][N]
me. But... I'll have my revenge very[N]
soon.[A]

[Right]#Luz
You seem to be burning with hatred[N]
towards the world. It is not a good[A][N]
mindset to have. I hope you find the[N]
right path with time.[A]

[Left]#Wigbrand
Trust me. I'm already on it. After a[N]
few months I ought be back where I[A][N]
should be. Then I won't need to listen[N]
to fanatics like you again. Farewell[A][N]
cleric.[A]

Wren never told me was so bitter...[N]
