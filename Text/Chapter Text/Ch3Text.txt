[MidLeft]#Wren
This isn't a good sight, I can see[N]
damage on the citadel, looks like the[A][N]
enemy already got here before we did.[N]
Your hunch was right Wigbrand...[A]

[MidRight]#Wigbrand
There still appears to be guards about,[N]
they're doing some repairs but they[A][N]
still look poised for battle. Perhaps[N]
they expect enemy reinforcements?[A]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
Don't worry, I'll get to the bottom of[N]
this. Captain! What events transpired[A][N]
here? Is my father safe?[A]

[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadWystanSoldier]

[MidRight]#Wystan Guard
Lady Sarai! We successfully fended off[N]
an enemy attack with the aid of Sir[A][N]
Kestral. However, he sustained heavy[N]
injuries against a Manakete general.[A][N]
He and Princess Adela are currently[N]
being held safe within the castle.[A]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
What of my father? I presume he aided[N]
in the defence of the citadel too, no?[A]

[MidRight]#Wystan Guard
Well...[A]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
Well... What? Don't leave me hanging![A]

[MidRight]#Wystan Guard
Duke Wystan as you know, is still[N]
recovering from the injury he sustained[A][N]
during the annual beef festival when he[N]
was trampled by a cow. The medication[A][N]
he is taking had some side effects that[N]
left him unable to battle.[A]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
I feel like you're not telling me the[N]
full picture, but whatever... Anyway,[A][N]
it's good to hear Sir Kestral is safe[N]
and sound for the most part, right[A][N]
Wren?[A]

[MidLeft]#Wren
Mhmm, my father can recover from any[N]
injury he faces, this wouldn't be the[A][N]
first time he's fought a Manakete.[N]
We may need to prepare for battle if[A][N]
it's true that enemy reinforcements may[N]
try to take advantage of the citadel's[A][N]
weakened state.[A]

[Left]#Wren
Duke Wystan! Mind if I ask what you're[N]
doing in the middle of the castle just[A][N]
after an invasion? I'm concerned for[N]
your safety.[A]

[Right]#Dunstan
Greetings Wren and Sarai! Well...[N]
Umm... this certainly isn't the state I[A][N]
wanted you both to see me in...[A]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
You've became fat haven't you, father?[N]
No wonder you sent me away with aunty[A][N]
for the holidays! You didn't want me to[N]
scold you for sneaking away to the[A][N]
pantry like you were going to just now.[A]

[Right]#Dunstan
You have to understand my position,[N]
Sarai! Since the injury I've been[A][N]
unable to excercise as much and food[N]
has been my way of coping with pain...[A]

[FarLeft][ClearFace]

[Left]#Wren
I've always known you to be a highly[N]
discplined warrior, Duke Wystan... Were[A][N]
you truly unable to protect the citadel?[A]

[Right]#Dunstan
Sadly, yes. Your father did much of the[N]
heavy lifting. He and princess Adela[A][N]
are recovering in the room guarded by[N]
those two Viripurian knights. I expect[A][N]
enemy reinforcements to arrive so be[N]
prepared to defend that point![A]

[FarLeft][LoadWigbrand]

[FarLeft]#Wigbrand
We should get you to safety in the[N]
meantime, Duke Wystan. Let's move out.[A]

[Right]#Dunstan
Oh... I'm afraid I can't do that...[A]

[FarLeft]#Wigbrand
You can't protect the citadel in your[N]
condition, so there's no use staying[A][N]
here.[A]

[Right]#Dunstan
No, I mean I quite literally cannot[N]
move! My bowels are not agreeing with[A][N]
suddenly... Any movement will send them[N]
into a mad fury... I must wait this[A][N]
predicament out. Not to worry, I know[N]
Rudyard should prove to be a competent[A][N]
ally while you defend me and the[N]
defence point.[A]

[Right][ClearFace]
[Right][LoadRudyard]

[Right]#Rudyard
There's nothing to worry about, milady.[N]
I'm a pretty hard hitter with my lance.[A][N]
Point me wherever, I'll sort it quick.[A]

[Left]#Wren
You sound confident, I think we can[N]
handle this then![A]

[Right]#Rudyard
Haha, if only I was confident in stuff[N]
other than twirling my lance around.[A]

[Left]#Wren
Oh...[A]

[Right]#Rudyard
You know what, forget I said that.[N]
Let's get this battle started![A]

[Left][LoadDunstanCiv]

[Right]#Wren
Looks like we've successfully defended[N]
the citadel. We shouldn't have to fight[A][N]
anymore reinforcements.[A]

[Left]#Dunstan
Outstanding work, Wren! My bowels are,[N]
however, still working against me. So I[A][N]
shall just... lay down here... Ah...[A]

[FarRight]#Sarai
Let's meet-up with  Sir Kestral and[N]
Adela, Wren! They should still be in[A][N]
that room over there.[A]
[X]

## Ch3ClosingText2

[Left][LoadWren]
[Right][LoadKestral]

[Left]#Wren
Father! I heard you were injured by a[N]
Manakete, are you recovering well?[A]

[Right]#Kestral
The lizard merely scratched me. Agh...![N]
Well, maybe a little more than that...[A][N]
But I'm fine, it's nothing to worry[N]
about. How fare you, my daughter? I can[A][N]
see your blade is worn... I thought I[N]
told you to keep her out of this,[A][N]
Wigbrand.[A]

[FarLeft][LoadWigbrand]

[FarLeft]#Wigbrand
I did my best to keep Lady Wren safe,[N]
Sir Kestral, but the invasion has been[A][N]
intense and any help I could muster on[N]
the battlefield was necessary to see us[A][N]
through, even with my skills.

[Right]#Kestral
Hmph, fair enough.[A]

[FarLeft][ClearFace]

[Left]#Wren
You're not displeased by me taking up[N]
arms for real now, are you father?[A]

[Right]#Kestral
No... Of course not, Wren. You're free[N]
to live your own life. I care not for[A][N]
what noblemen may utter about you.

[Left]#Wren
Thank you, father![A]

[Right]#Kestral
Well... I should head to the citadel's[N]
infirmary now. Once I'm healed up,[A][N]
we'll meet again in the capital.[N]
Goodbye, Wren. I'll give you some time[A][N]
with princess Adela now.[A]

[Left]#Wren
I love you too father, goodbye.[A]

[Right][ClearFace]
[Right][LoadAdela]
[FarLeft][LoadSarai]

[Right]#Adela
Wren! Sarai! Oh I am glad to see you[N]
two![A]

[Left]#Wren
Us too, Adela. We've been keeping up to[N]
date with the changing situation with[A][N]
the civil war.[A]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
Are you feeling fine right now, Adela?[N]
I heard about the death of your parents[A][N]
and what happened to prince Vladmir...[A]

[Right]#Adela
I'm... coping. It has not been easy but[N]
now that I am in the safety of loyal[A][N]
friends, my emotional recovery can only[N]
get easier from here on out.[A]

[Left]#Wren
We'll make sure to protect you with all[N]
our strength Adela. Has there been any[A][N]
word on Vladmir's status?[A]

[Right]#Adela
Unfortunately no. Last I saw of my[N]
brother was when he was defending the[A][N]
palace from one of the commander's of[N]
the rebels. He was locked into a battle[A][N]
with a dark rider... Both of them[N]
disappeared behind a cloud of smoke[A][N]
while the palace went up in flames...[N]
The dark rider still lives, but no word[A][N]
on my brother. Our spies were unable to[N]
confirm that the rebels had him killed.[A]

[Left]#Wren
Whoever this dark rider is... I'll make[N]
sure to avenge Vladmir by my own hand.[A]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
Revenge is a dangerous and slippery[N]
road to walk down, Wren.[A]

[Right]#Adela
I agree with Sarai, it's how we got[N]
into this situation in the first place.[A][N]
It's a never ending cycle...[A]

[Left]#Wren
I know... Sorry. It's just, Vladmir was[N]
my fiance...[A]

[Right]#Adela
I understand Wren. I'm sure we'll gain[N]
clarity in due time. For now, let's[A][N]
just focus on getting to safety in the[N]
capital.[A]

[Left]#Wren
Yes, you're right. I can't shake off[N]
the feeling however that we may still[A][N]
need to be prepared for enemies on the[N]
way however.[A]

[Right]#Adela
If such a situation arises Wren, I can[N]
aid you with my light magic and[A][N]
healing.[A]

[Left]#Wren
Thank you, Adela. Let's move out for[N]
the capital then.[A]

## Ch3WarningText

[MidLeft][LoadDunstanCiv]
Ah Wren! You may be unfamiliar with[N]
the layout of this fortress.[A][N]
Entrances to outside lead out from[N]
the carpets on the eastern and south[A][N]
western openings. The staircases by[N]
the south also leads to outside.[A][N]
Beware of all kinds of reinforcements[N]
emerging from these points![A]

Hyah![A]

Gwah![A]

[Right]#Wren
Huh, you seem sort of... out of it, for[N]
a pirate. Now I feel kind of bad for[A][N]
striking you.[A]

[Left]#Cato
Hard to feel gung ho about joining[N]
these Wyvember puppets.[A]

[Right]#Wren
You're not with the pirates?[A]

[Left]#Cato
Not by choice, no. This is what happens[N]
when you go against the imperialists.[A][N]
They turn you into fodder.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Ah, I see. You're from the Umbrake[N]
colony, aren't you?[A]

[Left]#Cato
Aye, that's right, why is that of[N]
interest to you?[A]

[Right]#Wren
With the way this war is progressing,[N]
we may be enroute for liberating the[A][N]
colony. What say you, interested?[A]

[Left]#Cato
Hmph, that's what the lizardskins said.[N]
But... I suppose it's kind enough that[A][N]
you took out the time to sway me. The[N]
dragons skipped that step.[A]

[Right]#Wren
So... it's a yes?[A]

[Left]#Cato
I'll tag along, for now. I can't[N]
promise I'll stick around, but should[A][N]
you disrespect the people of our tribe,[N]
well, your plans of liberation will be[A][N]
met with difficulty.[A]

[Right]#Wren
You have my word that it won't happen,[N]
