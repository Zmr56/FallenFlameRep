[MidLeft]#Wren
Looks like we're too late![N]
The citadel walls already show[A][N]
signs of damage from battle.[N]
Your hunch was right Wigbrand...[A]

[MidRight]#Wigbrand
Some guards are doing repairs but the[N]
rest still look poised for battle. Are[A][N]
more enemy reinforcements expected?[A]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
Don't worry, I'll get to the bottom of[N]
this. Captain! What events transpired[A][N]
here? How fares my father, Duke Wystan?[A]

[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadWystanSoldier]

[MidRight]#Wystan Guard
Lady Sarai! We successfully fended off[N]
an enemy attack with Sir Kestral's aid.[A][N]
We'll need your group's help though.[N]
Enemy reinforcements are anticipated to[A][N]
arrive but Sir Kestral is too weak at[N]
present to return to the frontline.[A][N]
Instead he is guarding princess Adela.[A]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
What of my father? I presume he aided[N]
in the defence of the citadel too, no?[A]

[MidRight]#Wystan Guard
Not quite, he's still incapacitated[N]
from injuries he received months back.[A]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
That's a shame to hear, well, at least[N]
papa and Sir Kestral are safe for now.[A]

[MidLeft]#Wren
Let's get ready then, the enemy[N]
could be here any minute now.[A]

[FarLeft]#Wren
Ahem! Father! Just what do you think[N]
you're up to wandering the citadel[A][N]
with only one retainer by your side?[A]

[FarRight]#Rudyard
One's plenty! Eh, Duke Wystan?[N][A]

[Right]#Dunstan
Greetings Wren and Sarai! I see I've[N]
caused some alarm amidst the chaos...[A][N]
Forgive me, my injuries have inflicted[N]
a dreadful pain unto me and I was on my[A][N]
way to find my remedy to null its bite.[N]
Rudyard here has kept me good company.[A]

[Left]#Wren
It's best you stay put for now, Duke[N]
Wystan. We're anticipating enemies to[A][N]
launch a second attack right here soon.[N]
Me and Sarai will guard you, we swear.[A]

[Right]#Dunstan
What's this? You and Sarai are battle[N]
hardened warriors now? Gwahahahahahaha![A][N]
Well, I suppose it makes sense when one[N]
reflects on who you have for parents.[A][N]
Just make sure to give them hell you[N]
wonderful pair of lovely lassies![A]

[FarRight]#Rudyard
...[N][A]

[Right]#Dunstan
Hmm? Oh! Of course! I'm sure you'll do[N]
a splendid job of the whole stabbing[A][N]
and bashing business too, Rudyard.[A]

[FarRight]#Rudyard
I appreciate the unwavering faith[N]
you place in me as ever, milord...[A]

[Right]#Wren
Guess we've defended the citadel now[N]
that Wyvember's troops are fleeing.[A][N]
That was the toughest fight yet...[A]

[Left]#Dunstan
Outstanding work, Wren! You guarded me[N]
wonderously and for that I am indebted.[A][N]
So I won't keep you waiting any longer,[N]
your father and princess Adela were[A][N]
sheltering in the room to the north.[A]

[FarRight]#Sarai
You meet up with them Wren, I'll have[N]
to give my father a stern word about]A][N]
his reckless behaviour, wandering off![A]

[Right][LoadKestral]

[Left]#Wren
Father! I heard you were injured![N]
Are you okay? Do you need help?[A]

[Right]#Kestral
Pah! It's nothing. Just fatigue.[N]
Princess Adela here has tended to[A][N]
my wounds in the meantime. Besides,[N]
what are you doing here in this ruckus?[A][N]
The battlefield is no place for a lady.[N]
I told you to keep her out of this,[A][N]
didn't I Wigbrand? Didn't I? Tch...[A]

[Left]#Wren
Calm down father! It's not his fault![N][A]

[FarLeft][LoadWigbrand]

[FarLeft]#Wigbrand
I did my best to keep Lady Wren safe,[N]
Sir Kestral, but the invasion has been[A][N]
intense and any help I could muster on[N]
the battlefield was necessary to see us[A][N]
through, even with my skills. Wren has[N]
came this far, clearly she inherits her[A][N]
mother's aptitutde for the battlefield.[A]

[Right]#Kestral
Hmph, fair enough.[N][A]

[FarLeft][ClearFace]

[Left]#Wren
You're not displeased by me taking up[N]
arms for real now, are you father?[A]

[Right]#Kestral
...[N]
I would rather it didn't have to come[A][N]
to this, but it is what it is. As I[N]
accepted your mother's decision to[A][N]
fight on the field, I suppose I must[N]
do the same with you, my daughter.[A]

[Left]#Wren
Thank you, father![N][A]

[Right]#Kestral
I'll save the rest of the pleasantries[N]
for when we'll reunite in the capital.[A][N]
There's business there of our concern.[N]
Now go, princess Adela awaits you.[A]

[Left]#Wren
I love you father, goodbye.[N][A]

[Right][ClearFace]
[Right][LoadAdela]

[Right]#Adela
Wren! Oh I am so relieved to see you![N][A]

[Left]#Wren
Adela! It's so good to see you're safe.[N][A]

[Right]#Adela
Nevermind me! You've crossed swords[N]
with all manner of ruffians lately![A][N]
I cannot thank you enough for coming to[N]
my aid. Oh, and I am most grateful to[A][N]
your father too, of course.[A]

[Left]#Wren
It's what friends do for one another.[N]
I have to thank you as well for tending[A][N]
to my father, I'd imagine he took some[N]
convincing to withdraw from the fight.[A]

[Right]#Adela
Indeed, he is a stubborn one, but[N]
he listened to reason in the end.[A][N]
It's the least I could do for him.[N]
He evacuated me from Viripuria after[A][N]
all, before rebels seized the capital.[N]

[Left]#Wren
Right, I heard about what happened to[N]
your family, Adela... Are you doing ok?[A][N]
I'd imagine you're finding it hard.[A]

[Right]#Adela
I-it's been hard, yes... Both of my[N]
parents were slain by the rebels while[A][N]
I escaped, I-I left leave them behind.[N]
I know I had to b-but... *sniff*[A]

[Left]#Wren
It's okay, Adela. I'm here. It's not[N]
your fault. What of your brothers?[A]

[Right]#Adela
Cyrus died trying to protect me and my[N]
parents... In the end only I survived[A][N]
though. Babak, he... He died as he[N]
tried to flee to Eastern Viripuria.[A][N]
I want to say Danial remains but...[N]
The brother I once knew has been[A][N]
swallowed wholly by a vengeance.[A]

[Left]#Wren
I can't imagine how difficult this has[N]
been for you. Once we reach the capital[A][N]
you can reunite with King Swithin. He's[N]
still family after all, you'll feel[A][N]
better with him, getting the best care.[A]

[Right]#Adela
Yes, you're right. Thank you, Wren.[N][A]

## Ch3WarningText

[MidLeft][LoadDunstanCiv]
Ah Wren! You may be unfamiliar with[N]
the layout of this fortress.[A][N]
Entrances to outside lead out from[N]
the carpets on the eastern and south[A][N]
western openings. The staircases by[N]
the south also leads to outside.[A][N]
Beware of all kinds of reinforcements[N]
emerging from these points![A]

[Right]#Wren
Hyah![A]

[Left]#Cato
Gwah![A]

[Right]#Wren
Too easy! Almost suspicously so...[N][A]

[Left]#Cato
I'm being sent out to die for nothing[N]
and I've been insulted by a young lass[A][N]
before I meet my end to boot. Amazing.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Huh? You don't want to do this?[N][A]

[Left]#Cato
Not at all. Wyvember loyalists in my[N]
tribe forced me to become fodder for[A][N]
Wyvember, lest a horrible fate befall[N]
the village I was the chieftain of.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Ah, I see. You wouldn't happen to be[N]
familiar with a woman called Svanhildr[A][N]
by any chance, elder...?[A]

[Left]#Cato
Cato, Cato of the Myotisi tribe.[N]
And yes, I have met Svanhildr a[A][N]
number of times, why do you ask?[A]

[Right]#Wren
She is my mother, so I have heritage[N]
from the same region of Gofaul. Except[A][N]
I belong to the Buboini tribe.[A]

[Left]#Cato
...! Well in that case I must join your[N]
side! The Buboini have been leading the[A][N]
struggle against Wyvember for so long.[N]
I know your mother is a trustworthy[A][N]
woman and so I pledge  my unwavering[N]
loyalty to you! I may be slightly grey[A][N]
but my Dark Magic spells are fearsome.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Oh um, sure! Strange to think I was[N]
*this* close to skewering you and[A][N]
now you've joined our rag-tag band.[A]

[Left]#Cato
Such are the twists and turns of life.[N][A]
