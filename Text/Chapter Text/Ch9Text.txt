Fall is soon coming to an end here[N]
alongside our campaign in Myotisi.[A][N]
My mission has grown past fending[N]
off invaders from home in Blumari.[A][N]
Now I find myself faced with the[N]
task of seizing Myotisi from the[A][N]
grip of the cruel druid Deuxnids...[A]

A word of advice, if you mind.[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
Hm?[N][A]

[Left]#Wigbrand

in on Deuxnids' throne room. He'll most[A][N]
likely have ambushes lying in wait.[A]

[Right]#Wren
I see... But as long as we wrap things[N]
up swiftly when we reach that point we[A][N]
may be able to avoid such misfortune.[A]

[Left]#Wigbrand
Aye.[A][N]
