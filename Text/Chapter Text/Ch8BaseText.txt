[Left]#Elder
We must thank you, from the bottom of[N]
our hearts, Lady Wren. Providing your[A][N]
soldier's labour in rebuilding our[N]
village is greatly appreciated.[A]

[Right]#Wren
It's our responsibility to do so now[N]
that this village is under our control.[A][N]
We also appreciate your village giving[N]
us a place to regather our strength.[A]

[Left]#Elder
I can imagine Drakemaw prison was an[N]
ordeal to escape at least. We've lost[A][N]
many good men and women to that place.[A]

[Right]#Wren
It was but no challenge is impossible.[N]
I cannot let any of my allies stay[A][N]
within the enemy's grasp.[A]

[Left]#Elder
If only the previous regiment that took[N]
part in the battle over our village had[A][N]
the same level of generosity as you.[N]
There'd be no need to clean up the mess[A][N]
that they left behind.[A]

[Right]#Wren
We apologise most profoundly for that.[N]
Unfortunately only so much of the army[A][N]
in Gofaul is directly supervised by me.[A]

[Left]#Elder
Well, you are a young lady after all.[N]
It would be unreasonable to expect you[A][N]
to be catapulted further to the top[N]
more than you have already been so.[A][N]
Others need to shoulder the burden too.[N]
Even if mistakes like this are made.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Thank you, elder. I'm just surprised[N]
you wouldn't feel inclined to curse us[A][N]
with every word under the sun given the[N]
village is in ruins and the land will[A][N]
be changing hands from Wyvember to us.[A]

[Left]#Elder
Look, you've stayed behind to help us[N]
rebuild and helped free our very own[A][N]
countrymen from Drakemaw. We should at[N]
least repay that effort for now. Later[A][N]
issues will be resolved when they come.[A]

[Right]#Wren
That's understandable, it's been nice[N]
talking to you, elder.[A]
