Hey Orvar, know where Shamira is?[N]
I thought she'd be at the training[A][N]
grounds.[A]

[Left]#Orvar
Nah, she won't be here at the castle.[N]
She doesn't really have good memories[A][N]
of the place.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Does she not even have old friends from[N]
her days at the academy?[A]

[Left]#Orvar
Well yeah but like, they're all[N]
probably patrolling town right now or[A][N]
deployed in Viripuria on the border.[N]
And even then, I could probably count[A][N]
my sis' mates on one hand. Still would[N]
have more than me though, heh.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Fair enough, although I'm sure she[N]
would've been fine with me around...[A][N]
By the way, what are you doing with[N]
that mop?[A]

[Left]#Orvar
Full water jugs are surprisingly heavy.[N]
I was caught off guard and the rest...[A][N]
Well, you get the picture.[A]

[Right]#Wren
This happened last year when we were[N]
here too, didn't it?[A]

[Left]#Orvar
Yep.[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
And did my grandpa get[N]
his cape wet again?[A]

Uh-uh. You'd think after all this[N]

[Right]#Wren
No, can't say I have, why do you ask?[N][A]

[Left]#Nuri
I need to give him a piece of my mind[N]
but it seems he scampered off...[A]

[Right]#Wren
What did he do to sour your spirits?[N]
I'll deal with it if you want me to.[A]

[Left]#Nuri
It's... complicated.[N]
And very personal.[A][N]
It's something I need to sort myself.[A]

Hmph, what do you want, woman?[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
Well I was going to ask you about the[N]
mission in Viripuria but if you're[A][N]
going to act like that, I won't waste[N]
my time.[A]

[Left]#Mordred
Oho? What's this? You're concerned[N]
about me for once?[A]

[Right]#Wren
Don't get the wrong idea, I couldn't[N]
care less about what happens to you.[A][N]
I'm just concerned about Adela,[N]
that's all.[A]

[Left]#Mordred
Well the princess' head is still stuck[N]
to her shoulders.[A][N]
What more could you ask for?[A]

[Right]#Wren
You very well know that isn't the full[N]
picture.[A]

[Left]#Mordred
Believe it or not but I pushed myself[N]
beyond my limits to rescue as much of[A][N]
the royal family as I could along with[N]
the rest of our team. If Prince Vladmir[A][N]
didn't appear to have a death wish then[N]
maybe your fiance would still be here[A][N]
with us. Alas, I suppose he may have[N]
had his demons bottled up inside that[A][N]
he wanted burnt down alongside himself[N]
and the palace as the rebels razed it.[A]

[Right]#Wren
I know very well my fiance didn't hold[N]
any secrets from me and you have no[A][N]
right to speculate on such. I'm sure[N]
you had the ability to save him.[A]

[Left]#Mordred
For once you don't doubt my strength?[N]
This relationship seems to be making[A][N]
good progress! Alas, you still doubt my[N]
intentions. But what reason could I[A][N]
have for letting Prince Vladmir die?[A]

[Right]#Wren
I'm not accusing you of anything,[N]
it's just... Well the two of you never[A][N]
really got along. So I wouldn't be[N]
surprised if you'd left him for[A][N]
whatever reason. Maybe you didn't mean[N]
to but...[A]

[Left]#Mordred
I never wanted there to be friction[N]
between me and the prince. There were[A][N]
some jokes that he just, misunderstood.[N]
I don't see any reason he should've[A][N]
taken our banter to heart unless...[A]

[Right]#Wren
I know what you're insinuating but if[N]
Vladmir truly felt like that he[A][N]
would've told me.[A]

[Left]#Mordred
Maybe he did tell you and you just[N]
don't want to admit it to the world?[A]

[Right]#Wren
It'd be wrong for me to feed your[N]
ravenous appetite for gossip so you can[A][N]
consider this conversation over.[A]

We're just discussing further matters[N]
after the briefing on the campaign.[A][N]
Are you feeling ok about all of this,[N]
my dear?[A]

[Right]#Wren
Absolutely grandfather. It won't be[N]
easy but, if I've gotten this far then[A][N]
there'll be no stopping me, I'm sure.[A]

[FarLeft]#Dunstan
Worry not Falcone! Wren has saved my[N]
life and she has my daughter by her[A][N]
side as ever. I'm confident you'll do[N]
well, won't you lassie?[A]

[Right]#Wren
Most certainly Duke Wystan.[N][A]

[FarLeft]#Dunstan
Besides, Duke Woadlan, the Randel[N]
family has always proven to be the[A][N]
Osprey family's most steadfast allies[N]
and will continue to do so, regardless[A][N]
of circumstances. You have my word that[N]
Sarai will protect her best friend with[A][N]
her life. Isn't that right, Lady Wren?[A]

[Right]#Wren
Indeed, Sarai has been immpeccable[N]
company over the invasion's duration.[A][N]
I'm sure she will continue to be so as[N]
we head into Gofaul.[A]

[Left]#Falcone
You seem to be quite comfortable with[N]
Lady Sarai going out on the campaign,[A][N]
Duke Wystan.[A]

[FarLeft]#Dunstan
Hm? I believe she will persevere.[N]
She is quite good on that pegasus,[A][N]

from having such an asset.[A]

Do not fret grandfather, I know you[N]
worry for me too but I inherit my[A][N]

thanks to my strict training! Gwahaha![A]

Speaking of Sir Kestral, will you be[N]
joining him in the Eastern Viripuria[A][N]
campaign along the border, Duke Wystan?[A]

[FarLeft]#Dunstan
I hope to, but I'll need to subject[N]
myself to training once more before I[A][N]
can enter the fray at my peak.[N]
I sincerely hope to fight alongside you[A][N]

I hope for the same too, Duke Wystan.[N][A]

[Left]#Falcone
Just be mindful of what's to come,[N]

I'm glad you feel as such. The city's[N]
Gofaullic Quarter is also a popular[A][N]

Is it common for the Blumari nobility[N]

[Right]#Wren
You're still training?[N]
Everyone's out relaxing in the grounds.[A]

[Left]#Soldier
Alas, the commander makes some of us[N]
play catch-up if he sees us slacking.[A][N]
Seyfaut's city guards are the best in[N]
Blumari for a reason, our discipline.[A]

[Right]#Wren
There also seems to be quite a few of[N]
the guards still out training too.[A]

[Left]#Soldier
You probably saw that we were swarming[N]
the castle grounds earlier during the[A][N]
meeting. The city guard is the largest[N]
armed force per head in Blumari![A][N]
The heart of government can't be[N]
defended on the cheap you know.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Usually in Woadlan we just had to rely[N]
on a small handful of elite knights or[A][N]
hastily arranged militas.[A]

[Left]#Soldier
Yeah, things are kind of dated back[N]
there. In Seyfaut a large portion of[A][N]
city guard is made up of common folk or[N]
former milita men from elsewhere out[A][N]
for higher pay, so we have the numbers.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Maybe Woadlan could learn from Seyfaut.[N][A]

[Left]#Soldier
Heh, they'll need more in their coffers[N]
to raise a force like ours.[A]

[Right]#Wren
I'm optimistic we'll figure it out.[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
Oh ack![N][A]

[Left]#Knight
Sorry about that milady![N]
Just polishing up the ol' shield.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Yes I can see that from the sun shining[N]
down on it. It's very polished indeed.[A]

[Left]#Knight
Armour sets in Blumari can't be made on[N]
the cheap after all. Blumari miners and[A][N]
blacksmiths are the most renowed in all[N]
of Balhutia due to our abudance of[A][N]
metals and our long history of forging.[N]
Only Wyvember and Eastern Viripuria are[A][N]
comparable to our work. That's why we[N]
knights need to do maintenance often.[A]

[Right]#Wren
I guess that's why all the best armour[N]
knights are from Blumari then?[A]

[Left]#Knight
Yes, but largely Orinde due to its[N]
longer history of mining. Woadlan could[A][N]
also be a great spot for mining! Yet[N]
its duke seems to wince at the thought[A][N]
of digging into the highlands, eh?[A]

[Right]#Wren
Well there's other things to take into[N]
account, the mountains and its wildlife[A][N]
are of great importance to Woadlanners.[N]
Disturbing them would cause many great[A][N]
concern.[A]

[Left]#Knight
Feh, that sounds like proper pagan talk[N]
to me. Some ancient deer worship pooey.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Well not all of us want the hustle and[N]
bustle of the mining country life.[A][N]
Some of us appreciate the quiet things[N]
in life, you know.[A]

[Left]#Knight
Eh, everyone wakes up to the smell of[N]
coin and commerce eventually.[A]

[Right]#Wren
You seem to be in deep thought about my[N]
father and Duke Orinde.[A]

[Left]#Knight
Oh! Greeting Lady Wren! Ignore my[N]
trivial musings.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Are you comparing the two in some way?[N][A]

[Left]#Knight
You could say so. Since they're both at[N]
the castle I've been wondering which of[A][N]
the two would win in a fight, what's[N]
your guess?[A]

[Right]#Wren
Hehe, well I'm sure you already know my[N]
answer.[A]

[Left]#Knight
Right... Sir Kestral. Duke Orinde is[N]
from a new generation however, he's got[A][N]
that youthful energy that gives him the[N]
edge in my opinion.[A]

[Right]#Wren
And my father doesn't? He's only thirty[N]
nine, I'd say he's in his peak, even.[A]

[Left]#Knight
That's a surprise, I thought he was[N]
much older, being a father and all.[A]

[Right]#Wren
My parents met when they were both[N]
pretty young.[A]

[Left]#Knight
I met my missus when I was twenty four,[N]
like most Blumari men. We're expecting[A][N]
the baby next year. I'm pretty thankful[N]
I'll be in Blumari for the birth since[A][N]
many of the men soon to be deployed to[N]
Viripuria won't get that luxury.[A]

[Right]#Wren
That's lovely to hear! I hope you're[N]
blessed with a wonderful child![A]

Aww thanks milady![N][A]

Duke Caerwyn, are you ok?[N][A]

[Left]#Cledwyn
Do I look ok to you, woman?[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
M-my apologies I didn't mea-[N][A]

[Left]#Cledwyn
Ah no, it's my fault, as usual.[N]
Seeing you reminds me of... them.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Right... My father and grandfather...[N][A]

[Left]#Cledwyn
Falcone is well aware of my distaste[N]
for Viripuria and we both have the same[A][N]
record on a non-interventionist stance.[N]
Yet the worm has cowered in at the last[A][N]
second this time to his son. Pathetic.[A]

[Right]#Wren
But I don't understand...[N]
We've been Viripuria's ally for many[A][N]
years now. Why wouldn't we join them?[A]

[Left]#Cledwyn
Hmph, did they not teach you history at[N]
school, Wren Osprey?[A]

[Right]#Wren
They did, I recall the events of the[N]
Farrlans War clearly. They were islands[A][N]
in our possession that Viripuria tried[N]
to take back as retribution for the[A][N]
schism within our churches. We won,[N]
however, so they still belong to us.[A]

[Left]#Cledwyn
See? There's the problem![N]
You know of the war as it reads on[A][N]
paper but it tells you nothing of the[N]
pain those who fought in it endured![A][N]
My father came home with one arm and[N]
one leg which still haunts me! There is[A][N]
no reason for me to be charitable to[N]
those who crippled my father.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Things have surely changed in the past[N]
60 years, no?[A]

[Left]#Cledwyn
Well I know they have not, and I'm[N]
sure you'll come to see what I mean,[A][N]
Wren. Quit your naivete.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Even so, why vote against the motion to[N]
deploy troops now? Usually you've only[A][N]
abstained on the matter as most of[N]
Caerwyn's representatives are more of[A][N]
interventionists.[A]

[Left]#Cledwyn
Hahaha... Look at me, Wren.[N]
Look at my face. I'm near the end of my[A][N]
life. I don't give a damn if Caerwyn's[N]
nobility replaces me with my grandson.[A][N]
It's not like I've much else to vote on[N]
with the time I have left, may as well[A][N]
make those votes count, eh? Haha-ack![N]
*cough* *cough*[A]

[Right]#Wren
Don't say that... I know you can liv-[N][A]

[Left]#Cledwyn
Forget it... I've accepted my fate.[N]
It doesn't trouble me... Look, don't[A][N]
waste your time with this relic...[N]
I don't understand why you've stuck[A][N]
around so long even after all the[N]
disrespect I've shown to you just now.[A]

[Right]#Wren
You've always treated me and grandpapa[N]
right. Sure you'd have bad days but...[A][N]
I get it. Especially now more than[N]
ever. You're not a coward to me...[A]

[Left]#Cledwyn
I really can't shake you off...[N]
Well, I've always said that if I was[A][N]
younger I would've wanted to have a[N]
daughter like you. Sons are the worst,[A][N]
If I'm honest.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Aw come on, you're a bit harsh on Gywn.[N][A]

[Left]#Cledwyn
Pah. I can't imagine you like him much[N]
either.[A]

I'm keeping my mouth sealed on that.[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
No it's fine! Don't worry, let it all[N]
out if you want to, I'll lend my ear.[A]

[Left]#Merc
Ya see, I'm a merc who's been hired by[N]
Blumari to form part of the auxiliary[A][N]
troops in Viripuria along with other[N]
milita men.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Let me guess, it's the prospect of[N]
fighting Manaketes that's making you[A][N]
feel really nervous?[A]

[Left]#Merc
Aye... The pay is kind of exciting[N]
though! What they're paying me for this[A][N]
is over ten times as much as I what I[N]
usually get paid![A]

[Right]#Wren
That's a really big leap...[N]
I can see why you're taking on the job.[A]

[Left]#Merc
And guess why Blumari can afford to[N]
pay us as much as they do. It's because[A][N]
only one in twenty of us will probably[N]
survive! That's what the history says.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Do you uhh... Think it's worth it?[N][A]

[Left]#Merc
Oh sure! I might be a nervous wreck but[N]
when I come back home it's goodbye to[A][N]

Usually you're around Mordred.[A]

That's Sir Gwyn Limestone to you.[N]
Anyway I'm having a smoke. Mordred gets[A][N]
annoyed whenever I smoke around him so[N]
I'm here on my own. Don't get the wrong[A][N]
idea, I'm not a loner like you are.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Haha, very funny.[N]
Well I can see why he would be annoyed.[A][N]
That's an awful smell.[A]

[Left]#Gwyn
Smoking is good for you, how it smells[N]
doesn't bother me. Your old man smokes[A][N]
too but he didn't wanna join me.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Anyway, I'm not a loner, just so you[N]
know. I have plenty of friends.[A][N]
Real friends, unlike you.[A]

[Left]#Gwyn
Sounds like horsedung to me.[N]
I bet you can't even name them.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Actually, I can.[N]
Sarai, Adela, Shamira, Dana and Orvar.[A]

[Left]#Gwyn
Ha! Five is nothing. I've got too many[N]
to count myself. I've rubbed shoulders[A][N]
with everyone in high society, being a[N]
knight. Well, I guess you sorta have[A][N]
too, but nothing really came out of it.[A]

[Right]#Wren
I could keep going off on you but your[N]
grandpa already gives you enough grief[A][N]
as is, even if he's sometimes right.[N]
Plus you're about to be fighting[A][N]
Manaketes soon so I'll let you off.[A]

[Left]#Gwyn
Manaketes are nothing. I don't need[N]
some specially crafted sword for[A][N]
stabbing them with, unlike you.[N]
Still, I don't get why they gave it to[A][N]
you of all people.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Probably because I'm not an airheaded[N]
knight who rides blindly into danger.[A]

Well I'm still alive after all these[N]

Nevermind. Logic and reason are wasted[N]
on you. Cheerio![A]
