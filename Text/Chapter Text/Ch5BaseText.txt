Here we are then, the capital.[N]
Seems we've all made it one piece.[A]

[Right]#Wren
I'm looking forward to finally being[N]
able to rest up my feet after all this.[A]

Hold! Lady Wren Osprey?[N][A]

Huh? Who called me just now?[N][A]

[Left]#Rentoul
Lady Wren Osprey and Wigbrand?[N]
The committee requires your audience.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Who are you? Who are all these men?[N][A]

[FarRight]#Wigbrand
His name is Rentaghoul.[N][A]

[Left]#Rentoul
It's Rentoul.[N][A]

[FarRight]#Wigbrand
Keep calling him Rentaghoul,[N]
he can't actually do anything about it.[A]

[Left]#Rentoul
It's a shame to see you haven't changed[N]
over the past twenty years, Wigbrand.[A][N]
There is no need to be alarmed milady.[N]
As the head of the Shadow Service I[A][N]
shall escort you to the war committee.[N]
The rest of you... Please clear off.[A]

Everyone is here now, King Swithin.[N][A]

[Left][LoadSwithin]

[Left]#Swithin
Thank you, Sir Rentoul.[N][A]

[FarLeft][ClearFace]

[Right]#Wren
Your majesty.[N][A]

[Left]#Swithin
Greetings, lady Wren.[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
Erm, may I ask why I've been brought to[N]
the committe? Not that I mind it's just[A][N]
that it seems unusual I'd be needed.[A]

[Left]#Swithin
I believe first of all, congratulations[N]
are due for your work in defending the[A][N]
nation recently during the invasion.[N]
The reason for your summoning, however,[A][N]
is that you possess a particular power[N]
that requires your deployment for the[A][N]
campaign in Gofaul and perhaps beyond.[A]

[Right]#Wren
I'm sorry but... I don't understand?[N][A]

[FarLeft][LoadRentoul]

[FarLeft]#Rentoul
Hush child! Do not spe-[N][A]

[Left]#Swithin
It's fine, Sir Rentag, uh, Rentoul.[N]
Lady Wren and I are usually informal.[A]

[FarLeft][ClearFace]

[Left]#Swithin
Lady Wren, has anyone told you before[N]
about your bloodline?[A]

[Right]#Wren
My bloodline is merely composed of the[N]
Osprey lineage and the Buboini tribe.[A][N]
I do not know of any other noteworthy[N]
traits that run through my veins.[A]

[Left]#Swithin
Well according to your father and your[N]
guard, Wigbrand, it'd seem your blood[A][N]
is extraordinary. Holy Blood so to say[A]

[FarRight]#Wigbrand
It is true.[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
H-Holy Blood...? I...[N][A]

[Left]#Swithin
I understand that this is a shock, so[N]
hold this blade, you may understand.[A]

[Right]#Wren
...![N]
A warm white flame is arising...[A][N]
But... It doesn't hurt at all...[A]

[Left]#Swithin
This is proof of your Holy Blood.[N]
Only you can wield this divine dragon-[A][N]
slayer. We constructed this blade from[N]
a dragon fang your father had on hand.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Is this dragon's blood that courses in[N]
my veins? How did you know I had such[A][N]
power and why hasn't anyone told me?[A]

[Left]#Swithin
The archbishop had a divine revelation[N]
from the ancesteral spirits before the[A][N]
invasion. They described a young maiden[N]
much like you, being able to wield the[A][N]
blade. Your father argued that it could[N]
only be you, based on dreams you had[A][N]
when you were very young similar to the[N]
archbishop's divine revelation.[A]

[Right]#Wren
I certainly remember no such thing...[N][A]

[FarLeft][LoadKestral]

[FarLeft]#Kestral
You were oh so very young, my love.[N]
It is only natural you'd forget.[A]

[Right]#Wren
V-very well...[N][A]

[Left]#Swithin
We feel you'll be the perfect counter[N]
to Wyvember's Manakete forces that are[A][N]
enroaching dangerously close to our[N]
colonies in Gofaul. Once them and their[A][N]
allies are dealt with you'll then press[N]
onto the Western Viripuria Empire to[A][N]
aid Princess Adela in reclaiming her[N]
kingdom. After that, you may be needed[A][N]
to help the rest of our forces against[N]
Wyvember on the Eastern border.[A]

[Right]#Wren
That sounds...[N][A]

[Left]#Swithin
It's a lot to take in, I know.[N]
For now just take this as a moment to[A][N]
to rest up alongside your troops.[N]
I... didn't want to send you off right[A][N]
away. Please, relax and think it over.[A]

[FarLeft]#Kestral
Don't worry, Wren. I'm here if you need[N]
to talk. I promise.[A]

[Right]#Wren
That's appreciated, father.[N]
It's been a pleasure, your majesty.[A]

[Left]#Nuri
Lady Wren! May I ask if you've seen[N]
Rudyard around anywhere?[A]

[Right]#Wren
No, can't say I have, why do you ask?[N][A]

[Left]#Nuri
I need to give him a piece of my mind[N]
but it seems he scampered off...[A]

[Right]#Wren
What did he do to sour your spirits?[N]
I'll deal with it if you want me to.[A]

[Left]#Nuri
It's... complicated.[N]
And very personal.[A][N]
It's something I need to sort myself.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Sorting it out doesn't happen to[N]
involve your axe by any chance?[A]

[Left]#Nuri
Uhhh...[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
I'll have a look for him, don't worry.[N]
Just, when you're in better spirits.[A]

[Left]#Nuri
That...  Seems sensible I guess.[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
Sensible is good.[N][A]

[Left]#Mordred
Hmph, what do you want, woman?[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
I was just wondering about your sister.[N][A]

[Left]#Mordred
She's fine. Although I can't see[N]
of what concern it'd be to you.[A]

[Right]#Wren
We weren't more than acquaintances but[N]
it was still a pleasure to see her.[A][N]
I just figured she'd be off wishing you[N]
well before you leave for Viripuria.[A]

[Left]#Mordred
Feh. I do not need well wishers.[N]
I shall hold my own just fine.[A]

[Right]#Wren
For crying out loud, I'm not trying to[N]
insinuate that you're weak at all.[A][N]
It's just, your sister usually sends[N]
off before any kind of campaign.[A][N]
Nor has she exchanged letters in a bit.[A]

[Left]#Mordred
Oh boohoo, my heart cries out for you.[N]
Why are you always on my case? Always[A][N]
hounding me for answers? Just like[N]
everyone else!? I'm sick to death of[A][N]
you, you half-breed monngrel![A]

Heavens above, simple conversations[N]
always end up blowing up in my face...[A]

Afternoon father! Wigbrand![N]
Oh uh, I hope I wasn't intruding on[A][N]
anything, was I?[A]

[Right]#Kestral
No, nothing at all darling. Did you[N]
want something important?[A]

[Left]#Wren
No I just wan-[N][A]

[Right]#Kestral
I'm afraid it'll have to wait for later[N]
then. Whatever it is we can discuss it[A][N]
some other time I'm sure. Goodbye Wren,[N]
have a nice day.[A]

[FarRight]#Wigbrand

need attending to. Goodbye.[A]
