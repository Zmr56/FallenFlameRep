[FarRight]#Wigbrand
Here we are then, the capital.[N]
Seems we've all made it one piece.[A]

[Right]#Wren
I'm looking forward to finally being[N]
able to rest up my feet after all this.[A]

[FarFarLeft]#Empty
I'm afraid that won't be possible.[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
Huh? Who called me just now?[N][A]

[FarLeft][LoadRentoul]

[FarLeft]#Rentoul
My name is Rentoul, the leader of his[N]
majesty's shadow service. Don't be[A][N]
alarmed, I'm simply here to escort both[N]
of you to his majesty...[A]

[Right]#Wren
O-ok...[N][A]

[FarRight]#Wigbrand
Nice to see you again, Rentaghoul.[N]
It's been some time hasn't it?[A]

Oh don't be so petty, let's get going.[N][A]

[FarLeft]#Rentoul
Everyone is here now, King Swithin.[N][A]

[Left][LoadSwithin]

[Left]#Swithin
Thank you, Sir Rentoul.[N][A]

[FarLeft][ClearFace]

[Right]#Wren
Your majesty.[N][A]

[Left]#Swithin
Greetings, lady Wren.[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
Greetings, your Majesty. May I...[N]
ask why I've been summoned? Usually one[A][N]
of my status does not gain this honour.[A]

[Left]#Swithin
After your efforts to defend Blumari, I[N]
believe you most certainly do.[A][N]
Your father will provide an overview[N]
of his role and then yours in this.[A]

[FarLeft][LoadKestral]

[FarLeft]#Kestral
Thank you, your majesty.[N]
Now, as you all know, mankind has been[A][N]
besieged by Wyvember on two fronts.[N]
In Gofaul, Wyvember incites rebellion[A][N]
in Blumari colonies and hires raiders[N]
to harass supply lines to our allies.[A][N]
This is where you'll be going, Wren.[A]

[Right]#Wren
O-ok... I'll accept this duty proudly.[N]
Although, why me and not someone else?[A]

[Left]#Swithin
You've already shown you're capable.[N]
Plus, diplomacy is essential to this[A][N]
campaign. Your preexisting ties to the[N]
region will be essential for building[A][N]
a coalition against Wyvember.[A]

[FarLeft]#Kestral
That and the presence of manaketes on[N]
the Wyvember-Viripurian border demands[A][N]
Blumari's finest troops such as myself,[N]
will be concentrated on this second[A][N]
front. As you stabilise the situation[N]
in Gofaul, we can then squeeze in on[A][N]
Wyvember from Viripuria and take the[N]
offensive, making Wyvember surrender.[A]

[Right]#Wren
I suppose I won't be seeing you for a[N]
while then, father. Going into Wyvember[A][N]
territory sounds incredibly risky. Will[N]
I be in risk of direct conflict against[A][N]
manaketes too? I don't think I'm ready.[A]

[FarLeft]#Kestral
Well...[N]
Yes.[A][N]
But! Fear not my child, our finest[N]
weaponsmiths have been working on a[A][N]
dragonslaying sword made exclusively[N]
for you. We call it, the 'Falchion'.[A][N]
I'll make sure to explain everything[N]
behind the blade later on, for now,[A][N]
just know it gets the job done.[A]

[Left]#Swithin
I suppose that's settled then.[N]
Feel free to wander about the halls for[A][N]
a bit, lady Wren. If there's any more[N]
to discuss, I'll be in the study room.[A][N]
This committee is now dismissed.[A]

[FarLeft][LoadAdela]

[Right]#Wren
...And thank you for allowing me to[N]
rest, your majesty. I will gather my[A][N]
troops and we will set off for Gofaul[N]
as soon as possible today. Farewell.[A]

[Left]#Swithin
You know, we won't be seeing each other[N]
for a long time. Loosen up if you want![A]

[Right]#Wren
Sorry, I just... You know, this is a[N]
really big step forward for me. Just[A][N]
months ago I was a regular girl and[N]
now I'm leading one of our campaigns![A]

[Left]#Swithin
I wish I didn't have to put you in this[N]
position, Wren. Unfortunately, the top[A][N]
brass in the army wouldn't budge on it.[N]
You possess a unique power they need.[A]

[Right]#Wren
I know... This revelation of being the[N]
wielder of blade like the Falchion has[A][N]
been a lot to take in too.[A]

[Left]#Swithin
I'd advise you head for Animahead,[N]
enroute to Gofaul. There the church[A][N]
leaders will be able to explain more[N]
about your unique circumstances.[A]

[FarLeft]#Adela
Don't worry about being alone either,[N]
Wren. I owe you one after what we've[A][N]
been through and I want to join you in[N]
your journey! It's the least I can do.[A]

[Right]#Wren
S-seriously? It'll be dangerous, Adela.[N]
We can't risk danger befalling you.[A]

[Left]#Swithin
Adela won't push herself too hard.[N]
Our family is nearly extinct, I know,[A][N]
but you've inspired us and Adela wants[N]
to continue in the tradition of the[A][N]
long standing alliance between our two[N]
nations by supporting you in battle.[A]

[FarLeft]#Adela
Truth be told, a lot of this conflict[N]
has been my own family's making.[A][N]
Who can blame the masses for looking[N]
to the Goldrev Republic as a change[A][N]
from Viripuria when my father and my[N]
brothers governed so poorly? I hate to[A][N]
say it but... That is the truth.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Don't feel the need to apologise for[N]
them, Adela. If you stay behind in[A][N]
Blumari I won't judge you at all.[A]

[FarLeft]#Adela
It's not that. I have the power to make[N]
a difference, to take my country back.[A][N]
You've shown as much and I believe in[N]
myself to do the same and that's[A][N]
something I want us to do together![A]

[Right]#Wren
Right... I understand. Are you sure[N]
you're okay with this, Swithin?[A]

[Left]#Swithin
Yes, I will miss Adela dearly, but[N]
Kevyn is taking good care of me.[A]

[Right]#Wren
I guess it's goodbye then...[N]
I'll write to you when I can though![A]

[Left]#Swithin
Likewise, goodbye, Wren.[N][A]

Lady Wren! May I ask if you've seen[N]
Rudyard around anywhere?[A]

[Right]#Wren
No, can't say I have, why do you ask?[N][A]

[Left]#Nuri
I need to give him a piece of my mind[N]
but it seems he scampered off...[A]

[Right]#Wren
What did he do to sour your spirits?[N]
I'll deal with it if you want me to.[A]

[Left]#Nuri
It's... complicated.[N]
And very personal.[A][N]
It's something I need to sort myself.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Sorting it out doesn't happen to[N]
involve your axe by any chance?[A]

[Left]#Nuri
Uhhh...[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
I'll have a look for him, don't worry.[N]
Just, when you're in better spirits.[A]

That...  Seems sensible I guess.[N][A]

Hmph, what do you want, woman?[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
I was just wondering about your sister.[N][A]

[Left]#Mordred
She's fine. Although I can't see[N]
of what concern it'd be to you.[A]

[Right]#Wren
We weren't more than acquaintances but[N]
it was still a pleasure to see her.[A][N]
I just figured she'd be off wishing you[N]
well before you leave for Viripuria.[A]

[Left]#Mordred
Feh. I do not need well wishers.[N]
I shall hold my own just fine.[A]

[Right]#Wren
For crying out loud, I'm not trying to[N]
insinuate that you're weak at all.[A][N]
It's just, your sister usually sends[N]
off before any kind of campaign.[A][N]
Nor has she exchanged letters in a bit.[A]

[Left]#Mordred
Oh boohoo, my heart cries out for you.[N]
Why are you always on my case? Always[A][N]
hounding me for answers? Just like[N]
everyone else!? I'm sick to death of[A][N]
you, you half-breed monngrel![A]

Understandably, the thought of Wren on[N]
the battlefield is distressing. Truly,[A][N]
I wish I could have done more to keep[N]
her out, but I hope this hasn't clouded[A][N]
your judgement of me in my ability to[N]
coordinate the support for Blakpeak's[A][N]
independence struggle against Wyvember?[A]

[Right]#Kestral
Wren would've needed to eventually,[N]
regardless. Obviously I'm not happy[A][N]
about it but... We have no choice.[A]

[Left]#Wren
No I just wan-[N][A]

No need for the formalities this time.[N]

[Right]#Wren
And that's the way I prefer it.[N]
You must be carrying a lot of weight on[A][N]
those shoulders of yours, with the war[N]
raging on and the recent invasion.[A]

[Left]#Swithin
It's funny. I'm sending you off to the[N]
battlefield but the first thing you do[A][N]
is dote on me, the king who sits around[N]
all day in an oversized throne.[A]

[Right]#Wren
It's not like that... It's just, you[N]
know, we're not gonna see each other[A][N]
for a while. I want to say goodbye to[N]
you as my friend, not the king.[A]

[Left]#Swithin
Strange isn't it, how our birthrights[N]
lock us into a life that strangles us.[A][N]
Both of us binded to positions of great[N]
power and misery in equal measure.[A][N]
Makes you wonder if these hierarchies[N]
are really of any benefit to anyone.[A]

[Right]#Wren
......[N][A]

[Left]#Swithin
Sorry, I'm sending you off on a[N]
miserable note. I have my utmost faith[A][N]
placed in you, Wren. Stay safe.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Don't worry about it. I'm not much of a[N]
philosopher but I got the gist of it.[A][N]
Likewise, I wish you all the best,[N]

Oh, hello. You called for me?[N][A]

We just wanted to say thank you.[N]
Thank you for saving my hide.[A]

I think I've already said it plenty but[N]
I want to say it again. Thank you for[A][N]
for everything you did in Aquanpool![A]

[FarRight]#Kevyn
Hey Wren, I haven't seen you in a while[N]
so I can finally thank you for keeping[A][N]
my sister and father safe. I owe you.[N]
Well, then again I'm not sure how I can[A][N]
pay you back. I'm needed in Seyfaut[N]
so I can guard the king constantly.[A]

[FarLeft]#Wren
It's fine, seriously. It's just how our[N]
two families always have been, really.[A][N]
For centuries, House Randel and House[N]
Opsrey have been there for each other.[A]

[Left]#Dunstan
Well yes, I understand it's very much[N]
a tradition, but it doesn't make our[A][N]
relationship any less personal. One[N]
day if I can, I'll fight in battle[A][N]
alongside you! I'm sure this injury[N]
will heal up before the war's end and[A][N]
you'll see me in my peak condition![A]

[Right]#Sarai
Don't try to convince this stubborn old[N]
codger, Wren. I said I'd have a word[A][N]
with him but he won't learn any sense.[A]

[FarRight]#Kevyn
In all fairness I haven't helped...[N]
Dad gets a lot of silly ideas from me.[A][N]
I reckon he could still go toe to toe[N]
with a manakete and then three more.[A]

[FarLeft]#Wrenn
Hopefully it won't come to that.[N][A]

[Right]#Sarai
Besides, you'll only need me to deal[N]
with any overgrown lizards we find.[A]

[FarLeft]#Wren
You're still coming along for the[N]
whole length of the campaign, Sarai!?[A]

[Right]#Sarai
Oh absolutely! Father and my brother[N]
are open minded about the whole battle[A][N]
maiden business. They've seen what I'm[N]
capable of and so have you! There's no[A][N]
room for doubt, you need a gal like me![A]

[Left]#Dunstan
Trust in Sarai, Wren. She's stronger[N]
than her adorable looks suggest![A]

[FarRight]#Kevyn
And she inherits dad's skill for[N]
disciplining out of line troops![A]

Mhmm! You know I'm a tough cookie![N][A]

I just wanted to say bye before you[N]

[Left]#Gwyn
You're saying bye to Mordred?[N]
This is a shock to me, weren't[A][N]
you two at each other's throats?[A]

[Right]#Wren
Never a moment where we aren't,[N]
but it's the polite thing to do.[A]

[Left]#Gwyn
Maybe you weren't as bad as I thought.[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
A lot of your thinking was just based[N]
on holding prejudiced beliefs about me.[A]

As usual, you don't know what you're[N]
