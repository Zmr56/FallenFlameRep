Hey Orvar, know where Shamira is?
I thought she'd be at the training
grounds.

#Orvar
Nah, she won't be here at the castle.
She doesn't want anything to do with
this place anymore.

#Wren
I guess. But does this place really put
Shamira off that much?

#Orvar
Yeah. Blooport folks tend to be like
that do that to us northerners.
Sis doesn't wanna deal with their
attitude. I don't blame her.

#Wren
Doesn't she have any friends here from
her days training as a guard?

#Orvar
Nope.

#Wren
Fair enough then...
That's a shame to hear.

#Orvar
Hey, she's got you, me and Dana.
Shammi's long past needing the company
of these high society military types.

#Wren
I guess. Thanks for the help anyway,
Orvar.

#Orvar
No problem, Wren.

#Wren
Actually, wait, why are you here then?

#Orvar
I've just been aimlessly walking around
because I haven't got a clue what to do
right now.

#Wren
I mean you could be practising your
archery at the archery range.

#Orvar
Tsk... Why you gotta remind me of
these chores...

#Nuri
Pardon me, Lady Wren, you haven't
happened to have seen that blaste-
I mean, sir Rudyard have you?

#Wren
Funnily enough, no. Can't say I have.
Even Lady Sarai was looking for him.

#Nuri
Typical...

#Wren
Umm, do you have history with sir
Rudyard? You seem to be familiar with
him.

#Nuri
Perhaps I do. I can't be sure for
certain though until I have a proper
talk with him. Not easy if we're never
in the same room.

#Wren
R-right... Well, I uh, hope you all the
best in finding him one day. I'm sure
you two will be fighting alongside each
other in the campaign ahead frequently
at least. Riders are a formidable force
when working together.

#Nuri
When they choose to... I doubt he'd
know the meaning of 'work' unless it
was written on a halberd coming for his
head.

#Wren
Oh uhh, I'm sure he's nothing like
that, ahaha... Duke Wystan and Lady
Sarai have only praises to sing of his
performance in battle.

#Nuri
A part of me finds that hard to
believe... But I can't doubt their
judgement. I dare not speak ill of
Viripuria's esteemed allies.

#Wren
Trust me Nuri, sir Rudyard will prove
himself as a dependable comrade.
I will make sure of it.

#Nuri
I really hope so, Lady Wren.
I really, really do.
