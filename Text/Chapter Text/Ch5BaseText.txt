[Right]#Wren
Hey Orvar, know where Shamira is?[N]
I thought she'd be at the training[A][N]
grounds.[A]

[Left]#Orvar
Nah, she won't be here at the castle.[N]
She doesn't really have good memories[A][N]
of the place.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Does she not even have old friends from[N]
her days at the academy?[A]

[Left]#Orvar
Well yeah but like, they're all[N]
probably patrolling town right now or[A][N]
deployed in Viripuria on the border.[N]
And even then, I could probably count[A][N]
my sis' mates on one hand. Still would[N]
have more than me though, heh.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Fair enough, although I'm sure she[N]
would've been fine with me around...[A][N]
By the way, what are you doing with[N]
that mop?[A]

[Left]#Orvar
Full water jugs are surprisingly heavy.[N]
I was caught off guard and the rest...[A][N]
Well, you get the picture.[A]

[Right]#Wren
This happened last year when we were[N]
here too, didn't it?[A]

[Left]#Orvar
Yep.[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
And did my grandpa get[N]
his cape wet again?[A]

[Left]#Orvar
Uh-uh. You'd think after all this[N]
fighting my dexterity would be better.[A]

[Right]#Wren
You really would.[N][A]

## NuriCh5Base

[Left]#Nuri
Lady Wren! May I ask if you've seen[N]
Rudyard around anywhere?[A]

[Right]#Wren
No, can't say I have, why do you ask?[N][A]

[Left]#Nuri
I need to give him a piece of my mind[N]
but it seems he scampered off...[A]

[Right]#Wren
What did he do to sour your spirits?[N]
I'll deal with it if you want me to.[A]

[Left]#Nuri
It's... complicated.[N]
And very personal.[A][N]
It's something I need to sort myself.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Sorting it out doesn't happen to[N]
involve your axe by any chance?[A]

[Left]#Nuri
Uhhh...[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
I'll have a look for him, don't worry.[N]
Just, when you're in better spirits.[A]

[Left]#Nuri
That...  Seems sensible I guess.[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
Sensible is good.[N][A]

## MordredCh5Base

[Right][LoadWren]
[Left][LoadMordred]

[Left]#Mordred
Hmph, what do you want, woman?[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
Well I was going to ask you about the[N]
mission in Viripuria but if you're[A][N]
going to act like that, I won't waste[N]
my time.[A]

[Left]#Mordred
Oho? What's this? You're concerned[N]
about me for once?[A]

[Right]#Wren
Don't get the wrong idea, I couldn't[N]
care less about what happens to you.[A][N]
I'm just concerned about Adela,[N]
that's all.[A]

[Left]#Mordred
Well the princess' head is still stuck[N]
to her shoulders.[A][N]
What more could you ask for?[A]

[Right]#Wren
You very well know that isn't the full[N]
picture.[A]

[Left]#Mordred
Believe it or not but I pushed myself[N]
beyond my limits to rescue as much of[A][N]
the royal family as I could along with[N]
the rest of our team. If Prince Vladmir[A][N]
didn't appear to have a death wish then[N]
maybe your fiance would still be here[A][N]
with us. Alas, I suppose he may have[N]
had his demons bottled up inside that[A][N]
he wanted burnt down alongside himself[N]
and the palace as the rebels razed it.[A]

[Right]#Wren
I know very well my fiance didn't hold[N]
any secrets from me and you have no[A][N]
right to speculate on such. I'm sure[N]
you had the ability to save him.[A]

[Left]#Mordred
For once you don't doubt my strength?[N]
This relationship seems to be making[A][N]
good progress! Alas, you still doubt my[N]
intentions. But what reason could I[A][N]
have for letting Prince Vladmir die?[A]

[Right]#Wren
I'm not accusing you of anything,[N]
it's just... Well the two of you never[A][N]
really got along. So I wouldn't be[N]
surprised if you'd left him for[A][N]
whatever reason. Maybe you didn't mean[N]
to but...[A]

[Left]#Mordred
I never wanted there to be friction[N]
between me and the prince. There were[A][N]
some jokes that he just, misunderstood.[N]
I don't see any reason he should've[A][N]
taken our banter to heart unless...[A]

[Right]#Wren
I know what you're insinuating but if[N]
Vladmir truly felt like that he[A][N]
would've told me.[A]

[Left]#Mordred
Maybe he did tell you and you just[N]
don't want to admit it to the world?[A]

[Right]#Wren
It'd be wrong for me to feed your[N]
ravenous appetite for gossip so you can[A][N]
consider this conversation over.[A]

[Left]#Mordred
Whatever, mongrel.[N][A]

## KestralCh5Base

[Left][LoadWigbrand]

[Left]#Wigbrand
I hope the events of this invasion[N]
haven't changed your mind on supporting[A][N]
my forces in Blackpeak.[A]

[Right]#Kestral
Can't say I'm satisfied you dragged[N]
Wren into all of this but...[A][N]
what must be done must still be done,[N]
the facts behind that haven't changed.[A][N]
You're still our best bet against them.[A]

[Left][ClearFace]
[FarRight][LoadWigbrand]

[Left][LoadWren]

[Left]#Wren
Afternoon father! Wigbrand![N]
Oh uh, I hope I wasn't intruding on[A][N]
anything, was I?[A]

[Right]#Kestral
No, nothing at all darling. Did you[N]
want something important?[A]

[Left]#Wren
No I just wan-[N][A]

[Right]#Kestral
I'm afraid it'll have to wait for later[N]
then. Whatever it is we can discuss it[A][N]
some other time I'm sure. Goodbye Wren,[N]
have a nice day.[A]

[FarRight]#Wigbrand
Sir Kestral and I have matters that[N]
need attending to. Goodbye.[A]

[Right][ClearFace]
[FarRight][ClearFace]

[Left]#Wren
I need to find out what's going on[N]
between the two, before it's too late.[A]
