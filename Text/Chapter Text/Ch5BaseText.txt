[FarRight]#Wigbrand
Here we are then, the capital.[N]
Seems we've all made it one piece.[A]

[Right]#Wren
I'm looking forward to finally being[N]
able to rest up my feet after all this.[A]

[FarFarLeft]#Empty
I'm afraid that won't be possible.[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
Huh? Who called me just now?[N][A]

[FarLeft][LoadRentoul]

[FarLeft]#Rentoul
My name is Rentoul, the leader of his[N]
majesty's shadow service. Don't be[A][N]
alarmed, I'm simply here to escort both[N]
of you to his majesty...[A]

[Right]#Wren
O-ok...[N][A]

[FarRight]#Wigbrand
Nice to see you again, Rentaghoul.[N]
It's been some time hasn't it?[A]

[FarLeft]#Rentoul
Oh don't be so petty, let's get going.[N][A]

[FarLeft]#Rentoul
Everyone is here now, King Swithin.[N][A]

[Left][LoadSwithin]

[Left]#Swithin
Thank you, Sir Rentoul.[N][A]

[FarLeft][ClearFace]

[Right]#Wren
Your majesty.[N][A]

[Left]#Swithin
Greetings, lady Wren.[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
Greetings, your Majesty. May I...[N]
ask why I've been summoned? Usually one[A][N]
of my status does not gain this honour.[A]

[Left]#Swithin
After your efforts to defend Blumari, I[N]
believe you most certainly do.[A][N]
Your father will provide an overview[N]
of his role and then yours in this.[A]

[FarLeft][LoadKestral]

[FarLeft]#Kestral
Thank you, your majesty.[N]
Now, as you all know, mankind has been[A][N]
besieged by Wyvember on two fronts.[N]
In Gofaul, Wyvember incites rebellion[A][N]
in Blumari colonies and hires raiders[N]
to harass supply lines to our allies.[A][N]
This is where you'll be going, Wren.[A]

[Right]#Wren
O-ok... I'll accept this duty proudly.[N]
Although, why me and not someone else?[A]

[Left]#Swithin
You've already shown you're capable.[N]
Plus, diplomacy is essential to this[A][N]
campaign. Your preexisting ties to the[N]
region will be essential for building[A][N]
a coalition against Wyvember.[A]

[FarLeft]#Kestral
That and the presence of manaketes on[N]
the Wyvember-Viripurian border demands[A][N]
Blumari's finest troops such as myself,[N]
will be concentrated on this second[A][N]
front. As you stabilise the situation[N]
in Gofaul, we can then squeeze in on[A][N]
Wyvember from Viripuria and take the[N]
offensive, making Wyvember surrender.[A]

[Right]#Wren
I suppose I won't be seeing you for a[N]
while then, father. Going into Wyvember[A][N]
territory sounds incredibly risky. Will[N]
I be in risk of direct conflict against[A][N]
manaketes too? I don't think I'm ready.[A]

[FarLeft]#Kestral
Well...[N]
Yes.[A][N]
But! Fear not my child, our finest[N]
weaponsmiths have been working on a[A][N]
dragonslaying sword made exclusively[N]
for you. We call it, the 'Falchion'.[A][N]
I'll make sure to explain everything[N]
behind the blade later on, for now,[A][N]
just know it gets the job done.[A]

[Left]#Swithin
I suppose that's settled then.[N]
Feel free to wander about the halls for[A][N]
a bit, lady Wren. If there's any more[N]
to discuss, I'll be in the study room.[A][N]
This committee is now dismissed.[A]

## NuriCh5Base

[Right][LoadWren]
[Left][LoadNuri]

[Left]#Nuri
Lady Wren! May I ask if you've seen[N]
Rudyard around anywhere?[A]

[Right]#Wren
No, can't say I have, why do you ask?[N][A]

[Left]#Nuri
I need to give him a piece of my mind[N]
but it seems he scampered off...[A]

[Right]#Wren
What did he do to sour your spirits?[N]
I'll deal with it if you want me to.[A]

[Left]#Nuri
It's... complicated.[N]
And very personal.[A][N]
It's something I need to sort myself.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Sorting it out doesn't happen to[N]
involve your axe by any chance?[A]

[Left]#Nuri
Uhhh...[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
I'll have a look for him, don't worry.[N]
Just, when you're in better spirits.[A]

[Left]#Nuri
That...  Seems sensible I guess.[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
Sensible is good.[N][A]

## MordredCh5Base

[Right][LoadWren]
[Left][LoadMordred]

[Left]#Mordred
Hmph, what do you want, woman?[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
I was just wondering about your sister.[N][A]

[Left]#Mordred
She's fine. Although I can't see[N]
of what concern it'd be to you.[A]

[Right]#Wren
We weren't more than acquaintances but[N]
it was still a pleasure to see her.[A][N]
I just figured she'd be off wishing you[N]
well before you leave for Viripuria.[A]

[Left]#Mordred
Feh. I do not need well wishers.[N]
I shall hold my own just fine.[A]

[Right]#Wren
For crying out loud, I'm not trying to[N]
insinuate that you're weak at all.[A][N]
It's just, your sister usually sends[N]
off before any kind of campaign.[A][N]
Nor has she exchanged letters in a bit.[A]

[Left]#Mordred
Oh boohoo, my heart cries out for you.[N]
Why are you always on my case? Always[A][N]
hounding me for answers? Just like[N]
everyone else!? I'm sick to death of[A][N]
you, you half-breed monngrel![A] 

[Left][ClearFace]

[Right]#Wren
Heavens above, simple conversations[N]
always end up blowing up in my face...[A]

## KestralCh5Base

[Left]#Wigbrand
I hope the events of this invasion[N]
haven't changed your mind on supporting[A][N]
my forces in Umbrake.[A]

[Right]#Kestral
I would've rather you kept Wren out of[N]
all this sooner earlier but...[A][N]
We need your support still.[A]

[Left][ClearFace]
[FarRight][LoadWigbrand]

[Left][LoadWren]

[Left]#Wren
Afternoon father! Wigbrand![N]
Oh uh, I hope I wasn't intruding on[A][N]
anything, was I?[A]

[Right]#Kestral
No, nothing at all darling. Did you[N]
want something important?[A]

[Left]#Wren
No I just wan-[N][A]

[Right]#Kestral
I'm afraid it'll have to wait for later[N]
then. Whatever it is we can discuss it[A][N]
some other time I'm sure. Goodbye Wren,[N]
have a nice day.[A]

[FarRight]#Wigbrand
Sir Kestral and I have matters that[N]
need attending to. Goodbye.[A]

So much for that promise then...[N][A]

## SwithinCh5Base

[Right][LoadWren]
[Left][LoadSwithin]

[Right]#Wren
Your Majesty.[N][A]

[Left]#Swithin
No need for the formalities this time.[N]
Rentoul isn't lurking in the shadows.[A]

[Right]#Wren
And that's the way I prefer it.[N]
You must be carrying a lot of weight on[A][N]
those shoulders of yours, with the war[N]
raging on and the recent invasion.[A]

[Left]#Swithin
It's funny. I'm sending you off to the[N]
battlefield but the first thing you do[A][N]
is dote on me, the king who sits around[N]
all day in an oversized throne.[A]

[Right]#Wren
It's not like that... It's just, you[N]
know, we're not gonna see each other[A][N]
for a while. I want to say goodbye to[N]
you as my friend, not the king.[A]

[Left]#Swithin
Strange isn't it, how our birthrights[N]
lock us into a life that strangles us.[A][N]
Both of us binded to positions of great[N]
power and misery in equal measure.[A][N]
Makes you wonder if these hierarchies[N]
are really of any benefit to anyone.[A]

[Right]#Wren
......[N][A]

[Left]#Swithin
Sorry, I'm sending you off on a[N]
miserable note. I have my utmost faith[A][N]
placed in you, Wren. Stay safe.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Don't worry about it. I'm not much of a[N]
philosopher but I got the gist of it.[A][N]
Likewise, I wish you all the best,[N]
Swithin.[A]
