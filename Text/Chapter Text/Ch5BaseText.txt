Here we are then, the capital.[N]
Seems we've all made it one piece.[A]

[Right]#Wren
I'm looking forward to finally being[N]
able to rest up my feet after all this.[A]

[FarFarLeft]#Empty
Hold! Lady Wren Osprey?[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
Huh? Who called me just now?[N][A]

[Left]#Rentoul
Lady Wren Osprey and Wigbrand?[N]
The committee requires your audience.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Who are you? Who are all these men?[N][A]

[FarRight]#Wigbrand
His name is Rentaghoul.[N][A]

[Left]#Rentoul
It's Rentoul.[N][A]

[FarRight]#Wigbrand
Keep calling him Rentaghoul,[N]
he can't actually do anything about it.[A]

[Left]#Rentoul
It's a shame to see you haven't changed[N]
over the past twenty years, Wigbrand.[A][N]
There is no need to be alarmed milady.[N]
I am the head of the Shadow Service.[A][N]
The nation's intelligence agency.[N]
I'll be escorting you and Wigbrand to[A][N]
his majesty right away...[A]

[FarLeft]#Rentoul
Everyone is here now, King Swithin.[N][A]

[Left][LoadSwithin]

[Left]#Swithin
Thank you, Sir Rentoul.[N][A]

[FarLeft][ClearFace]

[Right]#Wren
Your majesty.[N][A]

[Left]#Swithin
Greetings, lady Wren.[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
Greetings, your Majesty. May I...[N]
ask why I've been summoned? Usually one[A][N]
of my status does not gain this honour.[A]

[Left]#Swithin
First of all, I'd like to congratulate[N]
you on defending Blumari during the[A][N]
the invasion. The actual reason you're[N]
here, however, is to entrust this blade[A][N]
unto you. We call it, the Falchion.[N]
Here, grasp it.[A]

[Right]#Wren
...! A warm, white flame has arisen...[N]
But it doesn't hurt at all...[A]

[Left]#Swithin
We had suspicions that only you could[N]
use this blade. These flames confirm as[A][N]
much. The Falchion is still a work in[N]
progress but it is usable for now.[A][N]

[Right]#Wren
I take it I'm not going to be lounging[N]
at home with a sword like this though.[A]

[FarLeft][LoadRentoul]
Indeed. Your unique ability means we[N]
desperately require your deployment in[A][N]
Gofaul to assist our troops as we enact[N]
retribution against the invaders.[A][N]
And to give Falchion a test, of course.[A]

[Left]#Swithin
If you're wondering why this ability is[N]
unique to you, I would advise stopping[A][N]
at Animahead which ought be en route to[N]
Gofaul. The clergy there is much better[A][N]
than me at explaining the mystical.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Did you or father know anything about[N]
this beforehand, Wigbrand?[A]

[FarRight]#Wigbrand
Hm? Not at all. This is news to us.[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
Ok...[N][A]

[Left]#Swithin
I suppose that's settled then.[N]
Feel free to wander about the halls for[A][N]
a bit, lady Wren. If there's any more[N]
to discuss, I'll be in the study room.[A][N]
This committee is now dismissed.[A]

## NuriCh5Base

[Right][LoadWren]
[Left][LoadNuri]

[Left]#Nuri
Lady Wren! May I ask if you've seen[N]
Rudyard around anywhere?[A]

[Right]#Wren
No, can't say I have, why do you ask?[N][A]

[Left]#Nuri
I need to give him a piece of my mind[N]
but it seems he scampered off...[A]

[Right]#Wren
What did he do to sour your spirits?[N]
I'll deal with it if you want me to.[A]

[Left]#Nuri
It's... complicated.[N]
And very personal.[A][N]
It's something I need to sort myself.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Sorting it out doesn't happen to[N]
involve your axe by any chance?[A]

[Left]#Nuri
Uhhh...[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
I'll have a look for him, don't worry.[N]
Just, when you're in better spirits.[A]

[Left]#Nuri
That...  Seems sensible I guess.[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
Sensible is good.[N][A]

## MordredCh5Base

[Right][LoadWren]
[Left][LoadMordred]

[Left]#Mordred
Hmph, what do you want, woman?[N][A]

[Right]#Wren
I was just wondering about your sister.[N][A]

[Left]#Mordred
She's fine. Although I can't see[N]
of what concern it'd be to you.[A]

[Right]#Wren
We weren't more than acquaintances but[N]
it was still a pleasure to see her.[A][N]
I just figured she'd be off wishing you[N]
well before you leave for Viripuria.[A]

[Left]#Mordred
Feh. I do not need well wishers.[N]
I shall hold my own just fine.[A]

[Right]#Wren
For crying out loud, I'm not trying to[N]
insinuate that you're weak at all.[A][N]
It's just, your sister usually sends[N]
off before any kind of campaign.[A][N]
Nor has she exchanged letters in a bit.[A]

[Left]#Mordred
Oh boohoo, my heart cries out for you.[N]
Why are you always on my case? Always[A][N]
hounding me for answers? Just like[N]
everyone else!? I'm sick to death of[A][N]
you, you half-breed monngrel![A] 

[Left][ClearFace]

[Right]#Wren
Heavens above, simple conversations[N]
always end up blowing up in my face...[A]

## KestralCh5Base

[Left]#Wigbrand
I hope the events of this invasion[N]
haven't changed your mind on supporting[A][N]
my forces in Umbrake.[A]

[Right]#Kestral
I would've rather you kept Wren out of[N]
all this sooner earlier but...[A][N]
We need your support still.[A]

[Left][ClearFace]
[FarRight][LoadWigbrand]

[Left][LoadWren]

[Left]#Wren
Afternoon father! Wigbrand![N]
Oh uh, I hope I wasn't intruding on[A][N]
anything, was I?[A]

[Right]#Kestral
No, nothing at all darling. Did you[N]
want something important?[A]

[Left]#Wren
No I just wan-[N][A]

[Right]#Kestral
I'm afraid it'll have to wait for later[N]
then. Whatever it is we can discuss it[A][N]
some other time I'm sure. Goodbye Wren,[N]
have a nice day.[A]

[FarRight]#Wigbrand
Sir Kestral and I have matters that[N]
need attending to. Goodbye.[A]

[FarRight][ClearFace]

[Left]#Wren
So much for that promise then...[N][A]

## SwithinCh5Base

[Right][LoadWren]
[Left][LoadSwithin]

[Right]#Wren
Your Majesty.[N][A]

[Left]#Swithin
No need for the formalities this time.[N]
Rentoul isn't lurking in the shadows.[A]

[Right]#Wren
And that's the way I prefer it.[N]
You must be carrying a lot of weight on[A][N]
those shoulders of yours, with the war[N]
raging on and the recent invasion.[A]

[Left]#Swithin
It's funny. I'm sending you off to the[N]
battlefield but the first thing you do[A][N]
is dote on me, the king who sits around[N]
all day in an oversized throne.[A]

[Right]#Wren
It's not like that... It's just, you[N]
know, we're not gonna see each other[A][N]
for a while. I want to say goodbye to[N]
you as my friend, not the king.[A]

[Left]#Swithin
Strange isn't it, how our birthrights[N]
lock us into a life that strangles us.[A][N]
Both of us binded to positions of great[N]
power and misery in equal measure.[A][N]
Makes you wonder if these hierarchies[N]
are really of any benefit to anyone.[A]

[Right]#Wren
......[N][A]

[Left]#Swithin
Sorry, I'm sending you off on a[N]
miserable note. I have my utmost faith[A][N]
placed in you, Wren. Stay safe.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Don't worry about it. I'm not much of a[N]
philosopher but I got the gist of it.[A][N]
Likewise, I wish you all the best,[N]
Swithin.[A]
