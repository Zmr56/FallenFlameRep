Hello Luz, I see you're still at it[N]

reciting hymns after everyone else?[A]

Indeed. We have quite the challenge up[N]

ahead of ourselves. It's imperative we[A][N]

make sure our path ahead is blessed.[N]

That is part of my role after all,[A][N]

as a cleric in the army.[A]



[Right]#Wren

Do you mind if I join you briefly?[N][A]
