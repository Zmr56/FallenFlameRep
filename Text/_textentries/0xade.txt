[Left]#Adela
You... You look familiar.[A]

[Right]#Rudyard
Princess Adela! I don't believe we've[N]
ever met. I am a simple retainer of[A][N]
Duke Wystan after all, from a common[N]
background.[A]

[Left]#Adela
Is that so?[A]

[Right]#Rudyard
You can ask the Duke himself, he'll be[N]
more than happy to tell you of my[A][N]
background. There's no secrecy, I can[N]
assure you.[A]

[Left]#Adela
Fair enough. I just thought you looked[N]
like Erasyl Hasib, the heir to the[A][N]
Marqlans Sultanate. He was someone I[N]
knew of from Eastern Viripuria.[A]

[Right]#Rudyard
You flatter me. But I can assure you[N]
I'm no prince, sadly. I get that a lot,[A][N]
but you're mistaken. Farewell.[A]

[ClearFace][Right]

[Left]#Adela
Maybe I am... It's been a while since I[N]
saw Erasyl last anyway.[A]
