Lady Wren! While scouting the area with[N]
Huginn we saw the approach of bandits[A][N]
heading this way! If Orvar hadn't been[N]
out in the woods gathering mushrooms[A][N]
perhaps we'd be able to retrieve my[N]
father's gift to Duke Falcone before[A][N]
they arrived.[A]

[Left]#Orvar
I wasn't looking for mushrooms! I was[N]
actually the only one who thought to[A][N]
scout in the woods you know, bandits[N]
could be anywhere! Although these[A][N]
mushrooms I'm holding right now were[N]
just a lucky chance encounter.[A]

Save it for later Orvar,[N]
we've got bandits to bash.[A]

Aptly put as ever Huginn, seems like[N]
you'll be getting that valuable[A][N]
learning experience much earlier than[N]
anticipated, Lady Wren.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Aye, let's get to it then![A]
