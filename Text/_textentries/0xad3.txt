We're here Wigbrand, I've sent Sarai to[N]
scout the port just in case however.[A][N]
Uhh... Wigbrand? Where are you...?[A]

[MidRight][LoadWigbrand]

[MidRight]#Wigbrand
I'm... here... Wren... bleugh...[N][A]

[MidLeft]#Wren
Oh my! You look awfully pale! I didn't[N]
know that seasickness could get to you.[AN]

[MidRight]#Wigbrand
The sea is...[N]
not something I am[A][N]
accustomed to...[N]
Where's Sarai...?[A][N]
Is it safe up ahead?[AN][CloseSpeechSlow]

[MidRight]#Sarai
Here! And I'm afraid not... Pirates[N]
have swarmed the port up ahead, but[A][N]
we've got some support. My father[N]
anticipated our arrival so he's sent[A][N]
two of my retainers over, Luz and Gad![A][N][CloseSpeechSlow]

[MidRight]#Luz
Hello Lady Wren, If you need a heal in[N]
a pinch I'm more than happy to help and[A][N]
wish the Goddess' blessings upon you.[A]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
Oho, you're so polite, Luz. I'm quite[N]
envious of your grace. Now, introduce[A][N]
yourself, Gad![A]

[Right]#Gad
Hey Wren, I'm Gad. I open locks, steal[N]
treasure and look good doing it. If you[A][N]
need to know the best gambling dens on[N]
the Blumari coast I'm your guy![A]

[MidLeft]#Wren
I'd uhh... rather not. I value my[N]
relationship with the Goddess. Sorry.[A]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
Gad! Not like that![N][A]

[MidRight]#Luz
I tell myself to expect nothing decent[N]
from his behaviour yet he has the power[A][N]
to still disappoint. It's astonishing,[N]
really, Lady Wren.[A]

[Right]#Gad
Whatever, you nobles aren't any fun...[N][A]

Anyway... back with the task at hand,[N]
I believe taking out their commander[A][N]
should disperse the pirates from here.[N]
Once they've gone, we can press on.[A][N]
Sound good?[A]

[MidRight]#Sarai
Agreed, Wren. Let's head to it![N][A]

[FarRight]#Wigbrand
As long as we're not sailing off again,[N]
I really don't care what we do...[A]
