Oh my! Wigbrand, you look awfully pale.[N]
I can't heal up your sea sickness but[A][N]
I have some blessed herbs to relive you[N]
of your ailment.[A]

[Left]#Wigbrand
Pah, leave me alone. Your so called[N]
blessed herbs are mere vegetables.[A]

[Right]#Luz
How rude, I never knew you to have[N]
such a sharp tongue, Wigbrand.[A]

[Left]#Wigbrand
Hmph, I certainly do not need any[N]
blessings to see myself through. Gods[A][N]
and Goddesses have done nothing but[N]
bring me and this world misery.[A]

[Right]#Luz
I take it you're not a man of any faith[N]
then?[A]

[Left]#Wigbrand
Was. Then they stabbed me in the back[N]
and took everything I knew away from[A][N]
me. But... I'll have my revenge very[N]
soon.[A]

[Right]#Luz
You seem to be burning with hatred[N]
towards the world. It is not a good[A][N]
mindset to have. I hope you find the[N]
right path with time.[A]

[Left]#Wigbrand
Trust me. I'm already on it. After a[N]
few months I ought be back where I[A][N]
should be. Then I won't need to listen[N]
to fanatics like you again. Farewell[A][N]
cleric.[A]

Wren never told me was so bitter...[N]
Who must've hurt him?[A]
