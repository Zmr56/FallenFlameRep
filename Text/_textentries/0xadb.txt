[Right]#Sarai
Hey, Wren. Why can't we be travelling[N]
with the rest of the Blumari army?[A][N]
I just want to be sailing on a boat.[N]
All this riding is leaving me tired...[A]

[Left]#Wren
Sir Kestral still wants the escort[N]
mission to the capital to be on the[A][N]
down low. So a small force like ours is[N]
preferred to accompny Adela.[A]

[FarLeft]#Wigbrand
Sir Kestral does not want to risk a[N]
repeat of the last incident on seas.[A][N]
If we travel in a small group like ours[N]
we can reduce the risk of attracting[A][N]
enemy attention.[A]

[Left]#Wren
Speaking of enemies, has your scout[N]
returned yet, Adela?[A]

[FarRight]#Adela
Not yet, although I think I can see[N]
Nuri over the horizon there.[A]

[Right]#Nuri
Ready to report, princess Adela![A]

[FarRight]#Adela
How does the situation look up ahead,[N]
Nuri? You seem a bit tense.[A]

[Right]#Nuri
A band of enemies was spotted up ahead.[N]
I believe this is the last remnant of[A][N]
enemies that was left behind after the[N]
failed citadel attack. I suppose they[A][N]
wanted to leave some troops behind to[N]
attack us when we were more vulnerable.[A]

[Left]#Wren
It's nothing to worry about, Adela. I'm[N]
pretty confident by this point that we[A][N]
can push through this final batch of[N]
enemies unscathed. Once we're done with[A][N]
this lot, the invasion ought be over[N]
practically speaking.[A]

[FarRight]#Adela
I believe in you Wren. What's the[N]
objective then?[A]

[Left]#Wren
If we take out their commanders I think[N]
that will be enough for them to realise[A][N]
the invasion is lost. They'll disperse[N]
and we can press on ahead.[A]

[Right]#Nuri
You may want to be careful of the caves[N]
up ahead, Lady Wren. I could see[A][N]
Wyvern Riders lurking within. They may[N]
appear as reinforcements.[A]

[Left]#Wren
I'll keep that in mind, Nuri. Let's[N]
head out then.[A]
