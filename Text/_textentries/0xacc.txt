[MidLeft]#Dana
Drat... I can't believe I'm fleeing the[N]
castle like a coward! But, if it is the[A][N]
Duke's desire... Come! Hurry up Sarai![N]
We'll have to request back-up.[A]

[Left]#Sarai
Could you... slow down... a bit...?[N]
I'm getting real exhausted out here![A][N]
Riding a pegasus is new to me! I'm not[N]
a trained soldier like you...[A]

[MidLeft]#Dana
Sorry, can't slow down at all, not[N]
while we've got bloodthirsty bandits[A][N]
on our back hounding us down.[A]

[Left]#Sarai
Oh Dana! I think I see one up ahead![N]
His grim face and spiked armour makes[A][N]
me shiver...[A]

[MidLeft]#Dana
That's Wigbrand, Sarai... Looks like[N]
back-up came sooner than I thought![A][N]
Wren's here too! Hey Wren![A]

[MidRight][LoadWigbrand]

[Right]#Wren
Sarai! Dana! I'm glad to see you two![N]
What I'm not so glad to see are all the[A][N]
bandits here, it seems my worst fears[N]
were correct, they've taken the castle[A][N]
haven't they?[A]

[MidLeft]#Dana
They're still in the process of seizing[N]
it from within. Meanwhile some of their[A][N]
troops stand guard outside. I think the[N]
Duke isn't in danger if we act swiftly.[A][N]
We should seize the front to ease the[N]
burden of the castle guards inside.[A]

[Left]#Sarai
These ruffians have no manners, Wren![N]
We must show them who is really in[A][N]
control here![A]

[Right]#Wren
Oh, you're joining into the fray too?[N]
I didn't know you were eager for combat[A][N]
Sarai, I'm kind of nervous about you[N]
joining but I have faith in you![A]

[Left]#Sarai
Ahaha... uhmm, did I actually say we?[N]
That may've been a slip of the tongue![A]

[MidRight]#Wigbrand
You seem ready enough to join in, with[N]
those lances of yours, let's get to it.[A]

[Left]#Sarai
I mean these are just for my own[N]
protection Wiggy, ahaha...[A]

[MidRight]#Wigbrand
And you're under attack. So use them.[N]
We can't be next to you all the time,[A][N]
the enemy will spread us thin.[A]

[Left]#Sarai
Ughh... fine... How on earth do you put[N]
up with him Wren?[A]

[Right]#Wren
Wigbrand means well, it's no issue.[N]
Let's move out then, I believe in you[A][N]
two![A]
