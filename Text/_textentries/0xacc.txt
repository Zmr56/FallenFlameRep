[MidRight]#Wren
The commander has fallen and whatever's[N]
left has scattered. Do we pursue?[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
They've all gone their own ways, a[N]
lonesome crook is of no concern for us.[A][N]
Although I couldn't help but notice the[N]
unusual Gofaullian accent on the leader.[A][N]
Would you have any idea where they hail[N]
from Huginn?[A]

[Right][LoadHuginn]

[Right]#Huginn
Sounded like one from the east coast.[N]
I'd reckon he's from the confederate,[A][N]
not a Blumari bandit like the others.[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
It may very well be the case then that[N]
they have swarmed the rest of the[A][N]
mainland, colluding with bandits from[N]
Blumari to wreck havoc, prepare[A][N]
yourselves for more combat everyone.[A]

[MidRight]#Wren
We'll march home as swiftly as we can[N]
then. If the pirates and bandits are[A][N]
working together already then perhaps[N]
my father's prediction about the[A][N]
invasion was a good guess.[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
Best be ready to fight all manner of[N]
enemies then, knights and knaves alike.[A][N]

[MidRight]#Wren
Indeed, it's quite the unusual colation[N]
isn't it? Let's march on then and see[A][N]
for ourselves what their combined[N]
strength can do compared to our own.[A]
