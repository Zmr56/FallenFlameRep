[MidRight]#Wren
Phew... you took the air out of me[N]
there... Well... good enough for the[A][N]
frontlines now?[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
A distinct improvement from our last[N]
session. But being ready for the[A][N]
frontlines comes down to more than just[N]
being able to fight toe to toe with[A][N]
trained knights, when the enemy is out[N]
for blood and death is abound on the[A][N]
battlefield, it's a completely different[N]
story. Understood?[A]

[MidRight]#Wren
Mhmm, but I've bore witness to such[N]
things whenever you and father have[A][N]
taken me to battles. I might not have[N]
taken a life myself yet but I understand[A][N]
what's at stake.[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
I suppose so, your father and I have[N]
never been ones to hide the truth of[A][N]
war from you. Maybe you're ready after[N]
all. I'm confident in your knowledge of[A][N]
tactical theory but the only way to[N]
test your leadership abilities is to[A][N]
eventually put you through the wringer[N]
of an actual battle one day.[A]

[MidRight]#Wren
That could be soon even. I've heard [N]
from uncle that Hawkport has been[A][N]
barraged by a constant slew of[N]
Gofuallian pirates on the east.[A][N]
Supposedly they've formed a[N]
confederation to help organise an[A][N]
invasion force heading here for[N]
mainland Blumari.[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
I wouldn't put too much stock in it, it[N]
would take a mighty fierce leader to[A][N]
unite such a rabble. Perhaps your uncle[N]
is overestimating the threat, he's been[A][N]
thrown into the role of governor for[N]
the Hawkport colony suddenly by your[A][N]
grandfather, Duke Falcone in your[N]
father's abscence, he lacks experience.[A][N]
Granted, no one else would be a fit to[N]
take over from your father, wherever[A][N]
he is...[A]
