[Left]#Wren
Duke Wystan! Mind if I ask what you're[N]
doing in the middle of the castle just[A][N]
after an invasion? I'm concerned for[N]
your safety.[A]

[Right]#Dunstan
Greetings Wren and Sarai! Well...[N]
Umm... this certainly isn't the state I[A][N]
wanted you both to see me in...[A]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
You've became fat haven't you, father?[N]
No wonder you sent me away with aunty[A][N]
for the holidays! You didn't want me to[N]
scold you for sneaking away to the[A][N]
pantry like you were going to just now.[A]

[Right]#Dunstan
You have to understand my position,[N]
Sarai! Since the injury I've been[A][N]
unable to excercise as much and food[N]
has been my way of coping with pain...[A]

[FarLeft][ClearFace]

[Left]#Wren
I've always known you to be a highly[N]
discplined warrior, Duke Wystan... Were[A][N]
you truly unable to protect the citadel?[A]

[Right]#Dunstan
Sadly, yes. Your father did much of the[N]
heavy lifting. He and princess Adela[A][N]
are recovering in the room guarded by[N]
those two Viripurian knights. I expect[A][N]
enemy reinforcements to arrive so be[N]
prepared to defend that point![A]

[FarLeft][LoadWigbrand]

[FarLeft]#Wigbrand
We should get you to safety in the[N]
meantime, Duke Wystan. Let's move out.[A]

[Right]#Dunstan
Oh... I'm afraid I can't do that...[A]

[FarLeft]#Wigbrand
You can't protect the citadel in your[N]
condition, so there's no use staying[A][N]
here.[A]

[Right]#Dunstan
No, I mean I quite literally cannot[N]
move! My bowels are not agreeing with[A][N]
suddenly... Any movement will send them[N]
into a mad fury... I must wait this[A][N]
predicament out. Not to worry, I know[N]
Rudyard should prove to be a competent[A][N]
ally while you defend me and the[N]
defence point.[A]

[Right][ClearFace]
[Right][LoadRudyard]

[Right]#Rudyard
There's nothing to worry about, milady.[N]
I'm a pretty hard hitter with my lance.[A][N]
Point me wherever, I'll sort it quick.[A]

[Left]#Wren
You sound confident, I think we can[N]
handle this then![A]

[Right]#Rudyard
Haha, if only I was confident in stuff[N]
other than twirling my lance around.[A]

[Left]#Wren
Oh...[A]

[Right]#Rudyard
You know what, forget I said that.[N]
Let's get this battle started![A]
