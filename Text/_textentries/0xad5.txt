This isn't a good sight, I can see[N]
damage on the citadel, looks like the[A][N]
enemy already got here before we did.[N]
Your hunch was right Wigbrand...[A]

[MidRight]#Wigbrand
There still appears to be guards about,[N]
they're doing some repairs but they[A][N]
still look poised for battle. Perhaps[N]
they expect enemy reinforcements?[A]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
Don't worry, I'll get to the bottom of[N]
this. Captain! What events transpired[A][N]
here? Is my father safe?[A]

[MidRight]#Wystan Guard
Lady Sarai! We successfully fended off[N]
an enemy attack with the aid of Sir[A][N]
Kestral. However, he sustained heavy[N]
injuries against a Manakete general.[A][N]
He and Princess Adela are currently[N]
being held safe within the castle.[A]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
What of my father? I presume he aided[N]
in the defence of the citadel too, no?[A]

[MidRight]#Wystan Guard
Well...[A]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
Well... What? Don't leave me hanging![A]

[MidRight]#Wystan Guard
Duke Wystan as you know, is still[N]
recovering from the injury he sustained[A][N]
during the annual beef festival when he[N]
was trampled by a cow. The medication[A][N]
he is taking had some side effects that[N]
left him unable to battle.[A]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
I feel like you're not telling me the[N]
full picture, but whatever... Anyway,[A][N]
it's good to hear Sir Kestral is safe[N]
and sound for the most part, right[A][N]
Wren?[A]

[MidLeft]#Wren
Mhmm, my father can recover from any[N]
injury he faces, this wouldn't be the[A][N]
first time he's fought a Manakete.[N]
We may need to prepare for battle if[A][N]
it's true that enemy reinforcements may[N]
try to take advantage of the citadel's[A][N]
weakened state.[A]
