[Right]#Shamira
Lady Sarai! Where are your other[N]
retainers, Luz, Gad and Rudyard?[A]

[Left]#Sarai
Dana offered to escort me to Duke[N]
Falcone's. Luz and Gad were helping[A][N]
with fortifying the citadel back in[N]
Aquanpool. Rudyard is on guard there.[A]

[Right]#Shamira
That's unusual, why would we be[N]
fortifying Wystan citadel?[A]

[Left]#Sarai
Beats me. Nor me or my retainers know[N]
of the reason. My father has been tight[A][N]
lipped over what's going on. I can only[N]
presume we're preparing for an attack.[A]

[Right]#Shamira
Strange, I can't see how a ragtag force[N]
of pirates and mercenaries would get[A][N]
far inland with enough troops to lay[N]
siege to one of our citadels.[A]

[Left]#Sarai
Maybe there's a stronger enemy aiding[N]
them. Maybe the Wyvemberian Empire?[A]

[Right]#Shamira
That's possible. Maybe we'll run into[N]
them soon.[A]

[Left]#Sarai
Oh I hope not! Caeda is terrified of[N]
wyvern riders.[A]

[Right]#Shamira
...Caeda...?[A]

[Left]#Sarai
My pegasus![A]

[Right]#Shamira
Oh right... People name their mounts[N]
with human names... I'm no good at[A][N]
riding so this is unfamiliar to me.[A]

[Left]#Sarai
It's a cute name, isn't it?[A]

[Right]#Shamira
Well I wouldn't know what consitutes[N]
a cute pegasus name... You might be[A][N]
better off asking Lady Wren.[A]

[Left]#Sarai
Fair enough! Thanks for lending an ear[N]
Shammi![A]

[Right]#Shamira
...Shammi...?[A]
