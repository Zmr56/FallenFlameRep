Hyah![A]

[Left]#Cato
Gwah![A]

[Right]#Wren
Huh, you seem sort of... out of it, for[N]
a pirate. Now I feel kind of bad for[A][N]
striking you.[A]

[Left]#Cato
Hard to feel gung ho about joining[N]
these Wyvember puppets.[A]

[Right]#Wren
You're not with the pirates?[A]

[Left]#Cato
Not by choice, no. This is what happens[N]
when you go against the imperialists.[A][N]
They turn you into fodder.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Ah, I see. You're from the Umbralburg[N]
colony, aren't you?[A]

[Left]#Cato
Aye, that's right, why is that of[N]
interest to you?[A]

[Right]#Wren
With the way this war is progressing,[N]
we may be enroute for liberating the[A][N]
colony. What say you, interested?[A]

[Left]#Cato
Hmph, that's what the lizardskins said.[N]
But... I suppose it's kind enough that[A][N]
you took out the time to sway me. The[N]
dragons skipped that step.[A]

[Right]#Wren
So... it's a yes?[A]

[Left]#Cato
I'll tag along, for now. I can't[N]
promise I'll stick around, but should[A][N]
you disrespect the people of our tribe,[N]
well, your plans of liberation will be[A][N]
met with difficulty.[A]

[Right]#Wren
You have my word that it won't happen,[N]
elder.[A]

[Left]#Cato
What a polite lass.[A]
