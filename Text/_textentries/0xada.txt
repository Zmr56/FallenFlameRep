[Left]#Wren
Father! I heard you were injured by a[N]
Manakete, are you recovering well?[A]

[Right]#Kestral
The lizard merely scratched me. Agh...![N]
Well, maybe a little more than that...[A][N]
But I'm fine, it's nothing to worry[N]
about. How fare you, my daughter? I can[A][N]
see your blade is worn... I thought I[N]
told you to keep her out of this,[A][N]
Wigbrand.[A]

[FarLeft][LoadWigbrand]

[FarLeft]#Wigbrand
I did my best to keep Lady Wren safe,[N]
Sir Kestral, but the invasion has been[A][N]
intense and any help I could muster on[N]
the battlefield was necessary to see us[A][N]
through, even with my skills.

[Right]#Kestral
Hmph, fair enough.[A]

[FarLeft][ClearFace]

[Left]#Wren
You're not displeased by me taking up[N]
arms for real now, are you father?[A]

[Right]#Kestral
No... Of course not, Wren. You're free[N]
to live your own life. I care not for[A][N]
what noblemen may utter about you.

[Left]#Wren
Thank you, father![A]

[Right]#Kestral
Well... I should head to the citadel's[N]
infirmary now. Once I'm healed up,[A][N]
we'll meet again in the capital.[N]
Goodbye, Wren. I'll give you some time[A][N]
with princess Adela now.[A]

[Left]#Wren
I love you too father, goodbye.[A]

[FarLeft][LoadSarai]

[Right]#Adela
Wren! Sarai! Oh I am glad to see you[N]
two![A]

[Left]#Wren
Us too, Adela. We've been keeping up to[N]
date with the changing situation with[A][N]
the civil war.[A]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
Are you feeling fine right now, Adela?[N]
I heard about the death of your parents[A][N]
and what happened to prince Vladmir...[A]

[Right]#Adela
I'm... coping. It has not been easy but[N]
now that I am in the safety of loyal[A][N]
friends, my emotional recovery can only[N]
get easier from here on out.[A]

[Left]#Wren
We'll make sure to protect you with all[N]
our strength Adela. Has there been any[A][N]
word on Vladmir's status?[A]

[Right]#Adela
Unfortunately no. Last I saw of my[N]
brother was when he was defending the[A][N]
palace from one of the commander's of[N]
the rebels. He was locked into a battle[A][N]
with a dark rider... Both of them[N]
disappeared behind a cloud of smoke[A][N]
while the palace went up in flames...[N]
The dark rider still lives, but no word[A][N]
on my brother. Our spies were unable to[N]
confirm that the rebels had him killed.[A]

[Left]#Wren
Whoever this dark rider is... I'll make[N]
sure to avenge Vladmir by my own hand.[A]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
Revenge is a dangerous and slippery[N]
road to walk down, Wren.[A]

[Right]#Adela
I agree with Sarai, it's how we got[N]
into this situation in the first place.[A][N]
It's a never ending cycle...[A]

[Left]#Wren
I know... Sorry. It's just, Vladmir was[N]
my fiance...[A]

[Right]#Adela
I understand Wren. I'm sure we'll gain[N]
clarity in due time. For now, let's[A][N]
just focus on getting to safety in the[N]
capital.[A]

[Left]#Wren
Yes, you're right. I can't shake off[N]
the feeling however that we may still[A][N]
need to be prepared for enemies on the[N]
way however.[A]

[Right]#Adela
If such a situation arises Wren, I can[N]
aid you with my light magic and[A][N]
healing.[A]

[Left]#Wren
Thank you, Adela. Let's move out for[N]
the capital then.[A]
