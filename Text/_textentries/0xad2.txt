[MidRight]#Wren
Port looks safe now, no pirates in[N]
sight. I think we can press onto the[A][N]
Aquanpool Citadel safely now?[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
Should do, unless the enemy learnt of[N]
our next steps during their ambush on[A][N]
Sir Kestral at sea. An attack en route[N]
to the citadel or at the citadel itself[A][N]
are entirely possible in that instance.[A]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
Wiggy, you should try being an optimist[N]
more often. It's nothing to worry about[A][N]
Wren! Worst case scenario? My father,[N]
the renowed Shield of Blumari, Duke[A][N]
Wystan will simply eliminate them once[N]
they get there. He's strong you know![A][N]
Plus, it's his citadel, he knows it[N]
better than the enemy does.[A]

[MidRight]#Wren
Well, I suppose at a glance that sort[N]
of attack on a Blumari citadel seems[A][N]
unlikely to work, even if auxillary[N]
pirate cannon fodder is spreading our[A][N]
resources thin across the island.[N]
I'm struggling to see their rationale[A][N]
behind this reckless attack however.[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
As you know Western Viripuria is split[N]
in two by a bloody civil war. On one[A][N]
hand you have the Imperialists, on the[N]
other, the Wyvember backed forces,[A][N]
the Golden Revolutionaries. Right now[N]
Princess Adela and Emperor Ivan are the[A][N]
only members of the imperial dynasty[N]
that we know to be alive. Prince[A][N]
Vladmir's whereabouts are unknown.[A]

[MidRight]#Wren
I'm aware... It's been 6 months since[N]
he last replied to my letters...[A]

[FarLeft]#Sarai
It's alright Wren... I'm sure he's out[N]
there somewhere...[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
Ahem. Anyhow, if Wyvember were to kill[N]
Adela now, this would be a huge blow to[A][N]
the morale of the Imperialists while[N]
they're already in dire straits. Then[A][N]
they can focus their efforts on purging[N]
that dynasty and destroying the very[A][N]
thing the Imperialists fight for. Then[N]
it will only be a matter of time for[A][N]
the victory of the rebels to be sealed.[A]

[MidRight]#Wren
Even so, why do they need to already[N]
undertake a risky operation during this[A][N]
stage in the war?[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
Time is against the Manaketes. If they[N]
don't act fast, they'll continue to[A][N]
succumb to their degenerating mental[N]
state unless they expand into foreign[A][N]
lands where magic is more plentiful to[N]
sustain their dragon forms. The sooner[A][N]
they act, the better. Once they've[N]
strengthened their coalition of[A][N]
pirates, revolutionaries and dragons,[N]
they can take the Eastern Viripurian[A][N]
Empire where magic is in abundance.[A]

[MidRight]#Wren
Then I guess they're unlikely to hold[N]
back on this chance. We ought be[A][N]
prepared for such an outcome... Let's[N]
press on then.[A]
