[MidRight]#Wren
No bandits inside, looks like you were[N]
right, Wigbrand. Although... there's[A][N]
plenty of blood everywhere... That's[N]
going to stain the tiles for a while.[A]

[Right]#Wigbrand
I believe Duke Woadlan is approaching[N]
us, Wren. He looks untouched.[A]

[MidLeft][LoadFalcone]

[MidRight]#Wren
Grandpapa![A]

[MidLeft]#Falcone
Wren! Oh I am relieved to see you! I[N]
can't believe you're on the battlefield[A][N]
already... You've started sooner than I[N]
did... How are you finding it all?[A]

[MidRight]#Wren
It's fine and so am I, grandpapa. Well,[N]
it's not fine but you know what I mean,[A][N]
right?[A]

[MidLeft]#Falcone
No, don't worry, I fully understand.[N]
As long as you, your father and your[A][N]
uncle are fine, I'm fine![A]

[Right]#Wigbrand
Speaking of Sir Kestral, have you heard[N]
any word from him, Duke Woadlan?[A]

[MidLeft]#Falcone
Only today did I learn of his status.[N]
A messenger came to me so I could[A][N]
relay a message unto you. Kestral has[N]
departed from the Eastern Viripurian[A][N]
Empire with the princess of its Western[N]
half in his care. Princess Adela is[A][N]
expected to be kept safe within our[N]
capital. However, you're expected to[A][N]
rendezvous with your father at[N]
Aquanpool Port.[A]

[MidRight]#Wren
Why there? Wouldn't it have been easier[N]
for him to head straight for the[A][N]
capital?[A]

[MidLeft]#Falcone
He tried. But they were ambushed at sea[N]
by a particuarly powerful foe so they[A][N]
had to change course.[A]

[MidRight]#Wren
Hmmm, very well. I hope father is safe.[N]
We'll travel by boat to the port from[A][N]
here. Thank you, grandpapa, for the[N]
update. I've been worried sick having[A][N]
no word from father... It'd be nice to[N]
stick around but with these pirates[A][N]
invading I have no time to spare.[N]
Goodbye, grandpapa! I love you![A]

[MidLeft]#Falcone
I love you too Wren![N][A]

[MidRight][ClearFace]

[MidLeft]#Falcone
Tell me, Wigbrand, how does she truly[N]
fare? I cannoy imagine that girl has[A][N]
the fortitude to take a life, I barely[N]
could myself.[A]

[Right]#Wigbrand
She is stronger than you think. Things[N]
normally deemed the domain of men like[A][N]
us such as politics and war are no[N]
stranger to her. They are her lifelong[A][N]
passions.[A]

[MidLeft]#Falcone
Hmph, it is not a state of affairs many[N]
here or in the capital are happy with.[A][N]
But with the situation so dire around[N]
the world, I cannot afford to choose[A][N]
the gender of our commanders freely.[N]
We must take talent regardless of[A][N]
who possesses it. Man or not.[A]

[Right]#Wigbrand
I can vouch for her talent. I have no[N]
doubt that she will prove her worth in[A][N]
battle. Once the inevitable campaign in[N]
Gofaul starts, she will be the best[A][N]
candidate to lead a coalition there.[N]
Gofaul is her second home so to say, I[A][N]
think she's better equipped than others[N]
to gather the allies we need there.[A]

[MidLeft]#Falcone
I suppose there might be a silver[N]
lining in Kestral marrying that wild[A][N]
woman from Gofaul after all...[A]
