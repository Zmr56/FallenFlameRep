[Right]#Wren
Huginn, mind if I ask how your family[N]
fares in Gofaul? I heard fighting has[A][N]
been intense in the country on the[N]
colony frontier where they live.[A]

[Left]#Huginn
They don't live there no more. Muninn[N]
set up a blacksmith's in the capital[A][N]
with the gold from my mercenary work.[N]
Family moved with him so they're fine.[A][N]
Harvest wasn't any good so they had to[N]
give up on the farm.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Mhmm, I've heard this summer has been[N]
unusually wet, with plenty of flooding.[A]

[Left]#Huginn
It's the war. The titan spirits can't[N]
nurture the land if men are spilling[A][N]
blood between each other instead of[N]
the usual animal sacrifices.[A]

[Right]#Wren
I think it's just the changing weather.[N]
That's all. But then again, I'm not a[A][N]
pagan like other Gofaullians.[A]

[Left]#Huginn
Other Gofaullians? Aren't you from[N]
Blumari?[A]

[Right]#Wren
I am, but my mother is Gofaullian. So[N]
I'm half Gofaullian.[A]

[Left]#Huginn
This is news to me. Sir Kestral married[N]
a Gofaullian?[A]

[Right]#Wren
For anyone who knew him when he was[N]
younger it's no surprise I guess. But[A][N]
father is very different now.[A]

[Left]#Huginn
Hmm. Well, alright then.[A]
